# Spec & test approvals ledger

Append-only. The kernel specification and the semantics-bearing test surface are
OWNER-GATED. This file is the authorization record: an agent must obtain the
owner's explicit approval for a change to a guarded surface, append an entry
here, and only then commit. Approval of a plan or phase is **not** approval to
change the spec.

Guarded surfaces (see `tools/spec_guard.py`):

- numbered kernel specs `spec/kernel-spec-v*.md` — any add/remove/in-place edit;
- conformance expected verdicts `conformance/manifest.jsonl` + `conformance/cases/**`;
- frozen oracle digests in `tools/codegen_parity.py`, `tools/test_checked_automation.py`;
- reference semantics tests `prototype/checker/test_checker.py`, `prototype/democ/test_codegen.py`.

Adding a new test or a new conformance case is always allowed. Modifying,
deleting, or weakening an existing one — or regenerating a pinned oracle digest —
requires an approval below. Never make a failing check pass by changing what it
expects.

An approval that relaxes a rule or changes accepted semantics must rest on a
recorded investigation — the alternatives considered, pros and cons, a soundness
argument, and data — and must cite where that investigation is recorded (the
decision-gates.md line or dossier path). Every approval's stated reason must rest
on evidence, never on convenience or on the shape of existing code.

Protocol for an approved change:

1. Present the exact delta to the owner and get explicit approval in the session.
2. Make the change (numbered specs bump version + rename; never edit in place).
3. Run `make approve-spec REASON="<what the owner approved>"`. This regenerates
   `governance/guard-baseline.json` and appends an entry with its `baseline`
   hash. `make check`'s `spec-guard` layer fails on any guarded change whose
   baseline hash is not logged here.

Each entry records: the date, that the owner approved, the reason, the
`baseline` SHA-256 the approval authorizes, and, for a rule relaxation or
semantic change, a pointer to the recorded investigation it rests on.

## 2026-07-18 — approval
- owner: approved in session
- reason: Governance baseline: establish the spec/test guard at the committed main state (commit c18013b); no guarded content changed. Owner-directed governance lockdown 2026-07-18.

## 2026-07-18 — approval
- owner: approved in session
- reason: Owner-approved bounded-reborrow relaxation v0.6->v0.7 (statement-scoped child reborrow; OWN-5/6/9/12 + new STOR-5; PATTERNS P4). Approved in session 2026-07-18 after the recorded investigation at optimizer-language-research/implementation/reborrow-investigation/ (DOSSIER; model-check RESULTS 1M programs/0 violations; FR reconciliation; fact-channel review PASS-WITH-CONDITIONS; PACKET; V0.7-DELTA-DRAFT). Guarded changes: new spec kernel-spec-v0.7.md; three conformance META annotations re-versioned to v0.7. No test or oracle weakened.

## 2026-07-18 — approval
- owner: approved in session
- reason: Owner-approved region-retention checkpoint (THE-PLAN Phase-2 next step, salvaged from parked_edits, 2026-07-18): fix conformance case x-typ-value-where-borrow-param.wf malformed region param [r]->['r] + explicit region arg (same TYPE-5 reject verdict; required now that stage-0 democ correctly enforces FORM-3 region spelling). Also pins the additive test_codegen.py region-arg tests. No expected verdict weakened; the case still rejects at TYPE-5.

## 2026-07-20 — approval
