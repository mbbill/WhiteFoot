# Protected approval record

This file contains the append-only approval record. It is not a workflow guide;
the sole live governance procedure is [`WORKFLOW.md`](../WORKFLOW.md). Entries through
the hash-baseline era remain unchanged historical records, followed by the
newer exact-artifact and protected-change approvals.

## 2026-07-18 — approval
- owner: approved in session
- reason: Governance baseline: establish the spec/test guard at the committed main state (commit c18013b); no guarded content changed. Owner-directed governance lockdown 2026-07-18.
- baseline: 0e876fd68b1da613de96364ba1d5ce33ccebe7c3ea508b0ad0d2dc06f9709749

## 2026-07-18 — approval
- owner: approved in session
- reason: Owner-approved bounded-reborrow relaxation v0.6->v0.7 (statement-scoped child reborrow; OWN-5/6/9/12 + new STOR-5; PATTERNS P4). Approved in session 2026-07-18 after the recorded investigation at optimizer-language-research/implementation/reborrow-investigation/ (DOSSIER; model-check RESULTS 1M programs/0 violations; FR reconciliation; fact-channel review PASS-WITH-CONDITIONS; PACKET; V0.7-DELTA-DRAFT). Guarded changes: new spec kernel-spec-v0.7.md; three conformance META annotations re-versioned to v0.7. No test or oracle weakened.
- baseline: 48cc850aabdbd730792f2f973d85f13896cbea01e3eb2f387963e9f3d29b1db6

## 2026-07-18 — approval
- owner: approved in session
- reason: Owner-approved region-retention checkpoint (THE-PLAN Phase-2 next step, salvaged from parked_edits, 2026-07-18): fix conformance case x-typ-value-where-borrow-param.wf malformed region param [r]->['r] + explicit region arg (same TYPE-5 reject verdict; required now that stage-0 democ correctly enforces FORM-3 region spelling). Also pins the additive test_codegen.py region-arg tests. No expected verdict weakened; the case still rejects at TYPE-5.
- baseline: 48843fae8d276b06bd3c5f61e5e08b1c440055ed42ad7b529b52a30410c359d8

## 2026-07-19 — approval

## 2026-07-22 — ledger scope amendment

The hash-baseline guard described above was retired on 2026-07-22. Its entries
remain unchanged as the exact audit record for the period in which it operated.
Later approvals record the approved artifact or change boundary directly and do
not invent a retired baseline hash.

Owner rulings before this separate ledger began on 2026-07-18 are preserved in
`archive/governance/directives.md` and in the versioned records indexed by
`archive/governance/decision-log.md`. They are not duplicated here because many of them
authorized research or selected a direction without approving a protected
specification or test change.

## 2026-07-21 — approval
- owner: approved in session
- reason: Approve the exact Phase-5 successor proposal SHA-256 `7fc48cc30f94d25be5be1106e3265d92c1b0cdf2bfea5a7a17759a12f3cf092d` and generated v0.10 candidate SHA-256 `71073e25219455896250e15e13d1ffdbfc443c87a9b28cb9906d73a020dc33e9`. The approval selected the reviewed language delta and architecture consequences but did not itself install v0.10 or authorize resolver implementation.
- evidence: `archive/governance/decisions/v0.9.md` (`PHASE5-SUCCESSOR-OWNER-APPROVAL`)

## 2026-07-22 — approval
- owner: approved in session
- reason: Correct the protected `fn7-neg-two-mains` evidence to v0.10 TYPE-6 duplicate-declaration behavior and authorize preparation, hostile review, and owner presentation of the bounded v0.11 semantic-closure candidate. This did not approve candidate activation before exact-byte review.
- evidence: `archive/governance/decisions/v0.10.md` (`V010-DUPLICATE-MAIN-CORRECTION-AND-V011-SEMANTIC-CLOSURE-AUTHORIZATION`)

## 2026-07-22 — approval
- owner: approved in session
- reason: Select `propagate` as the sole ERR-3 Result-forwarding spelling, with no `try` compatibility alias, and approve exact v0.11 candidate SHA-256 `050e110c8c5eb3143c9d3f54968a9df9125f1d4b5991f527b8a15938a4292fbc` for append-only activation with synchronized compiler, conformance, and reference-model updates.
- evidence: `archive/governance/decisions/v0.11.md` (`V011-PROPAGATE-SPELLING-CANDIDATE-FREEZE` and `V011-OWNER-APPROVED-ACTIVATION`)

## 2026-07-22 — approval
- owner: approved in session
- reason: Remove the stale `KNOWN GAP` wording from the protected `xfail-own1-bare-affine-use` conformance source now that the compiler implements its existing OWN-1 rejection. The program, manifest verdict, rule assignment, and reference expectation are unchanged.
- evidence: owner approval immediately following the nominal-data compiler slice at commit `58e9c43`

## 2026-07-22 — approval
- owner: approved in session
- reason: Repair the repo-wide consistency findings without changing a released specification, an existing conformance verdict, or a runnable status. Correct stale conformance explanations and coverage annotations to the active v0.11 architecture, archive the unmanifested duplicate const fixture, replace nonexistent-tool claims with native checks, repair live documentation and design-memory drift, and prepare—but do not activate—the existing v0.12 candidate with current governance references.
- evidence: owner instruction “I think we need to fix all the issues” following the complete repository consistency review

## 2026-07-22 — approval
- owner: approved in session
- reason: Correct five malformed protected expectations whose `accept` kind caused their nested runtime result to be ignored. `op2-pos-sat-mode`, `const2-pos-array-lookup`, `own1-pos-tagonly-copy`, `type2-pos-buffer-tagonly`, and `type2-pos-twostate-enum-i1` now require the already-documented successful execution result (`run`, exit 0). Their sources, rule assignments, runnable statuses, and language behavior are unchanged. The manifest validator now rejects fields that do not belong to the declared expectation kind.
- evidence: owner instruction “forget about 0.12. make sure everything else is good” following the consistency report that identified these exact five malformed expectations

## 2026-07-22 — approval
- owner: approved in session
- reason: Retire the active `tests/reference/` Python model and preserve it intact under `archive/tests/reference/`. The model consumes its own historical toy AST and does not exercise or compare with the Rust compiler, so it is removed from the active language-change workflow and repository gate. No released specification, compiler behavior, conformance source, verdict, status, or codegen policy changes.
- evidence: owner instruction “just move it to the archive and fix all the references”

## 2026-07-22 — approval
- owner: approved in session
- reason: Approve exact v0.12 candidate SHA-256 `e2d5566379891454c090e037bd45c5f1a8df90ba23506a0f83ce9aaa03b41463` for append-only activation. The change adds SET-1 copy-place assignment and synchronizes target ordering, storage, ownership, effects, diagnostics, and governance references. No existing conformance source, expected verdict, or runnable status is changed; the activation adds focused cases and switches live identities.
- evidence: `governance/spec-evolution/kernel-spec-v0.12-candidate.md`; native grammar verifier passed 62 productions, 72 decisions, and 72 terminals; exact rule-body audit found fifteen modified rules plus SET-1; two hostile reviews passed before the owner approved the exact hash.

## 2026-07-22 — approval
- owner: approved in session
- reason: Approve exact v0.13 candidate SHA-256 `ed93cc43a6a224725f813b1adfc4c19fbb64dc5ab294b25d924392d2959b77cd` for append-only activation. The direct `propagate` operand becomes a consuming context for a bare affine place rooted in a live own-mode binding, while explicit `move`, same-E checking, borrow restrictions, cleanup, effects, runtime behavior, and required checks remain unchanged. Also approve source-only repairs, with every existing verdict and runnable status unchanged: write required affine returns explicitly, correct unexhibited `traps` rows to `pure`, add missing minimal `main` declarations to the affected propagation cases, and give the three affected Result match fixtures fresh GRAM-10 binders.
- evidence: `governance/spec-evolution/kernel-spec-v0.13-candidate.md`; native grammar verifier passed 62 productions, 72 decisions, and 72 terminals; the exact rule-body audit found only TYPE-6, OWN-1, STOR-1, FN-4, ERR-3, DIAG-2, and DIAG-3 changed; owner instruction “approved” immediately following presentation of the exact hash and protected repair boundary.

## 2026-07-22 — approval
- owner: approved in session
- reason: Approve exact v0.14 candidate SHA-256 `31c09313363304f405c8db1191d1982e3625b86788bf953ec3bb169648466e9f` for append-only activation and synchronized compiler and conformance updates. The change closes the existing three-row `ineg` judgment: wrapping minimum remains minimum, trapping minimum follows OP-2 and the existing mandatory empty-message record, checked minimum returns `Err(Overflow())`, and every other input returns its exact mathematical negation. No existing conformance source, verdict, or runnable status changes; activation adds focused cases and switches live identities.
- evidence: `governance/spec-evolution/kernel-spec-v0.14-candidate.md`; native grammar verifier passed 62 productions, 72 decisions, and 72 terminals; the exact rule-body audit found only TYPE-6, STOR-1, OP-2, FN-4, DIAG-2, and DIAG-3 changed; owner instruction “approved” immediately following presentation of the exact hash and no-protected-change boundary.

## 2026-07-23 — approval
- owner: approved in session
- reason: Correct five protected conformance discrepancies without changing v0.14. Add the `allocates(heap)` effect exhibited by `buffer_new` to `pending-op9-buffer-new` and `op4-trap-index-oob`; make `type2-pos-buffer-tagonly` test the legal `buffer<Bool>` type and its affine transfer without calling the primitive-only `buffer_new` row; retain projected-copy coverage in `own1-pos-match-projected-copy` while using a primitive buffer element admitted by that row; and change `fn8-neg-requires-non-bool-check` from TYPE-5 to the OP-5 rejection explicitly selected by FN-8. The five statuses and expectation kinds remain unchanged; only the last case's expected rule changes.
- boundary: corrected source SHA-256 values are `pending-op9-buffer-new` `989ceff1b6ac87351a0d099ea70e55b9f25c0243b704402257c2af988269d2f5`, `op4-trap-index-oob` `d836c74fb6213fb836e1a601d88d514f14aeab3a077a0a1f998b8766003f03c5`, `type2-pos-buffer-tagonly` `a2eff4ad6383e31c2d215564432c9536472543460fcdd0d955d592b51daaf4ac`, and `own1-pos-match-projected-copy` `dff17036062faaeaada0a32a5dfe4136bbb48e50f6ad35673a094b12e58ed9b9`; unchanged `fn8-neg-requires-non-bool-check` source is `0e45fdbc844a122f615384a79f9ff08d02a6bc7aa3e05945344ee0a80c4fcb90`; resulting `tests/conformance/manifest.jsonl` is `d8a0730244e75c4cc2508b8029130deb37e68f6e957e9477e4c9eeab4957b83f`.
- evidence: owner instruction “1 approved” immediately following presentation of the exact five-case correction boundary; `make conformance` covers all 93 active v0.14 rules after the correction.
