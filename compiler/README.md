# Whitefoot production compiler

This is the permanent safe-Rust implementation of the Whitefoot compiler. Its
exact initial language target is `spec/kernel-spec-v0.8.md`, SHA-256
`d04336f7fa8d1a6a0f03fe58a17f972b658217a73a3dff91a906b4ba295328a8`.

The workspace is in Phase 2. It establishes production contracts and
verification boundaries; it is not yet a source-to-code compiler and makes no
conformance or release claim.

## Current crates

- `whitefoot-contract` owns deterministic, judgment-free data contracts: the
  exact specification identity, ordered source bundles, source identities and
  bundle-bound spans, explicit resource ceilings, and the first canonical
  artifact framing.
- `whitefoot-verifier` depends only on `whitefoot-contract`. Its first real
  judgment verifies that an artifact is bound to the expected specification
  and exact ordered source bytes. Verified state has no public constructor.

Frontend, semantic, diagnostic, and command-line modules will be added only
when they contain real production behavior. The independent verifier remains a
separate crate. Lowering becomes a separate crate when a real backend exists,
so the dependency graph can prevent raw frontend state from reaching it.

No active code imports the retired implementations under `archive/`.

The ordered multi-file bundle is a toolchain input envelope around v0.8's one
closed program, not a new language rule. Each file will contain complete
top-level items; combined declaration order is file order followed by item
order, while per-file UTF-8 and canonical formatting remain FORM-2 frontend
judgments. Invalid raw bytes therefore survive bundle construction.

## Gate

Run:

```sh
make -C compiler check
```

The gate verifies the exact Rust toolchain fingerprint and v0.8 bytes, enforces
the closed two-package dependency graph and inherited lint policy, rejects
symlinks, build scripts, procedural macros, unapproved dependencies, and paths
outside this workspace, then checks formatting, builds, lints, tests, and
rustdoc. The reproducibility layer copies the complete compiler source to two
different paths and physical files, builds both release graphs, and compares
every Cargo-declared workspace artifact under collision-checked logical keys.

Absolute checkout paths otherwise enter stable-rustc library metadata and make
all four current release artifacts differ across source copies. The gate uses
stable `--remap-path-prefix` flags for both the copied source root and its target
directory. The two builds never share a checkout or target directory, and the
gate uses no nightly compiler option.

The toolchain alias is `1.91`; `toolchain-lock.json` closes that alias to exact
rustc and Cargo releases and commits, LLVM, rustfmt, Clippy, profile, and
component set. Dependency resolution and builds run with Cargo's locked,
offline controls (`--locked --offline`), so the exact toolchain must already be
installed. The current graph has no external package. Before one is admitted,
the clean reproducibility builds need a reviewed vendoring or deterministic
source-population strategy; an ordinary caller cache is insufficient. This is
an offline Cargo guarantee, not a claim that rustup can install a missing
toolchain without network access. `dependencies.json` binds its complete
external-package allowlist to the exact `Cargo.lock` bytes.
