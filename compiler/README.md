# Whitefoot production compiler

This directory contains the one permanent safe-Rust implementation of the
Whitefoot compiler. There is no disposable compiler and no parallel
self-hosting track.

The immutable active specification and evidence baseline is
`../spec/kernel-spec-v0.9.md`, SHA-256
`bdfb461d1901f610633c5cbcd2477d24df3c77ca90599b9580c8289e50b82b68`.
The immutable v0.8 specification and its compiler-local identity locks remain
historical evidence. Compiler code may not reinterpret either version.
`../THE-PLAN.md` is the sole source for implementation order and authorization.

## Handoff state

Phase 1's audited foundation handoff is complete. The workspace now
establishes source, lexical, grammar-derivation, identity, resource, and build
boundaries. It is not yet a source-to-code compiler and makes no conformance
or release claim.

Phase 2's standalone grammar-change verifier and evidence package are complete.
That tool stays outside the production compiler dependency graph. The exact
owner-approved v0.9 successor is now the active compiler target. Installing its
identity does not create production parser, semantic, artifact, backend, or
release authority; later work still follows the gates in `../THE-PLAN.md`.

Phase 3's exact-v0.9 installation and Phase 4's canonical frontend are complete.
The frontend ends at one source-bound `CanonicalSyntaxUnit`. Phase 5 is not
active until its separately listed semantic discrepancies and A-questions are
closed.

## Current crates

- `whitefoot-contract` owns judgment-free contracts: exact specification and
  nominal catalog identities, bounded ordered source transport, source
  identities and spans, resource ceilings, and the version-1 source-binding
  wire format. Owned construction reports limit and allocation failures.
- `whitefoot-language-data` depends only on `whitefoot-contract`. It owns the
  complete exact-v0.9 terminal predicate inventory and pure spelling
  membership functions. It does not inspect source bundles, select grammar
  alternatives, or grant acceptance.
- `whitefoot-lexer` depends only on `whitefoot-contract`. It losslessly
  partitions exact source bytes into shape-only tokens and retained trivia
  under explicit ceilings. It does not classify grammar terminals, parse,
  resolve, or accept a program.
- `whitefoot-syntax-data` depends only on the contract and language data. It
  owns immutable, generated exact-v0.9 production, source-EBNF, diagnostic
  provenance, and strong-LL(2) data. A separate repository tool regenerates
  and byte-checks that data from the numbered specification. The crate contains
  no parser and grants no syntax authority.
- `whitefoot-syntax` depends only on the contract, language data, lexer, and
  syntax data. It classifies every formed token context-free, retains every
  matching predicate, and uses a resource-bounded iterative LL(2) parser to
  derive every v0.9 production into one private postorder representation over
  the complete ordered source bundle. One linear finalizer checks the single
  root, production shape, parent/child topology, source ownership and extents,
  and exact token coverage. A streaming tree-driven FORM-2 comparison over the
  same derivation is the sole constructor of canonical syntax. The crate has no
  backtracking, priority choice, recovery, synthetic tokens, semantic
  disambiguation, or semantic authority.
- `whitefoot-source-audit` depends only on `whitefoot-contract`. It checks that
  a decoded candidate binding names the expected specification and reproduces
  the exact source transport. It does not replace the binding codec's separate
  canonical-byte validation and is not an artifact verifier, semantic checker,
  or independent production authority.
- `whitefoot-lexical-observer` is a binary-only development adapter over the
  contract and lexer. It exposes the lexer's closed outcome families to an
  independent byte-level model. Requests and responses are observation data,
  not tokens with portable identity, parser output, verdicts, receipts, or
  checked artifacts.

The active specification forms one compilation unit from an ordered, nonempty
sequence of logical source records. `SourceBundle` preserves source order and
exact bytes, but this judgment-free contract alone does not prove every PROG-2
input-envelope requirement or create a parsed program root.

The parser's failure-atomic private derivation and the opaque finalized
intermediate are not acceptance verdicts. Only a completed source audit yields
`CanonicalSyntaxUnit`, which proves syntax and exact FORM-2 bytes but no name,
type, ownership, effect, or other semantic rule. No resolver, semantic kernel,
semantic record, artifact schema, backend, compiler executable, conformance
adapter, or release capability exists here yet. No active code imports the
retired implementations under `../archive/`.

## Later production authority path

After the specification and phase gates permit it, production acceptance uses
one semantic kernel:

```text
canonical syntax
  -> one semantic kernel
  -> private checked draft
  -> target qualification
  -> canonical artifact projection
  -> artifact-only decode and complete replay through the same kernel
  -> accepted compilation from replay-decoded state
  -> conservative generic lowering
```

Only mandatory replay in the originating invocation may construct lowering
authority. There is no second production semantic certificate verifier.
Same-kernel replay detects incomplete projection, codec, reference, and
corruption defects; it is not independent semantic evidence and does not
reduce the trusted semantic kernel. The current source-audit crate is not a
placeholder for that future replay boundary.

Optional optimizer propositions are a separate later overlay with their own
independent family verifiers. The canonical empty overlay must always lower
correctly, preserving every unproved runtime check.

## Non-authority data

The capability overlay at `../capabilities/whitefoot-rust/v0.9/`, the static
semantic catalog, discrepancy registry, source index, corpora, and experiment
receipts are audit evidence only. Production code must not read them to select
acceptance, semantic handling, or lowering. A digest proves byte identity, not
truth, completeness, or implementation capability.

The version-1 `WFSOURCE` codec remains exactly source transport plus
specification identity. Catalog, tree, proof, semantic, target, and backend
identities do not belong in it. No future artifact envelope should be created
until its canonical schema and real consumer are authorized.

## Gates

Run the compiler gate from the repository root:

```sh
make -C compiler check
```

Run the complete development gate before and after a completed repository
slice:

```sh
make check
```

The compiler gate pins the exact Rust toolchain, v0.9 bytes, static catalog
identity, package graph, dependencies, source policy, formatting, linting,
tests, rustdoc, and cross-path reproducibility. Builds are locked and offline;
the required toolchain must already be installed. The workspace forbids
`unsafe`, build scripts, procedural macros, unapproved dependencies,
source-splicing, and archive imports.

A green gate describes only this complete canonical frontend and the earlier
foundation. It does not claim semantic acceptance, conformance, lowering, or
release.
