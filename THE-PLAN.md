# THE PLAN (consolidated 2026-07-15)

The single current-state document: what this project believes, what it has
proven, and what it does next. Supersedes the DECISION_SPRINT/ROADMAP phase plans
(kept in archive/). Law lives in CONSTITUTION.md; rulings in
`optimizer-language-research/notes/user-directives.md`; the lab notebook in
`optimizer-language-research/implementation/decision-gates.md`. This file is
the map, re-derived from those sources; on conflict, they win in that order.

## 1. What xlang is

A systems language for AI-written, human-approved code (D0a). Entire bug
classes are unrepresentable (memory corruption, races, silent overflow,
uninitialized reads — T1/T2/D1) via an ownership/region/effects checker with
no unsafe escape (W3). The checker's proofs double as optimizer facts (P0).
One canonical spelling per program (FORM-1/2). The spec fits in a context
window (D2 — still binding per owner: context is the resource that survives
model scaling). Design patterns are a closed, taught catalog, at architecture
scale as at statement scale (D6, PATTERNS.md).

## 2. Standing rulings (digest — full text in user-directives.md)

- D0a AI-authored, human-approved. D1a simple checker: reject-when-unsure.
- D2a spec compactness binds; program verbosity does not.
- D3 never copy Rust by default; lexicon names checked invariants.
- D4 rewrite-first, FFI-narrow.
- D5 broad model-tier writer sprint deprioritized; D9a narrowly requires one
  fixed low-tier run to measure the production default path.
- D6 pattern doctrine: catalog must be complete AND efficient; taught, not
  discovered.
- D7/D7a impact target: swap-in everyday artifacts; headline formula is
  faster + parity + bug-class-unrepresentable + AI-authored. Safe-direction
  constraint: performance/correctness framing only.
- D9a confidence gate: compare one fixed `gpt-5.6-terra`/medium model's first
  correctness-green xlang artifact with one exact, unmodified, commonly used
  shipped Rust library. Freeze before timing; facts-on/off explains the win.
  Expert Rust is ceiling evidence only. Replicate once before a broad claim.

## 3. Evidence to date — honest ledger

Measured wins (real, replicable, with caveats in each RESULTS.md):
- Floor-raising (binary-trees): the slow design is unrepresentable; ports
  land on the fast shape by construction. The 12x-vs-Box number is a shape
  effect — identical-shape Rust is ~11% faster than us (checked-semantics
  tax, part of which is xlang doing MORE checking than release Rust).
- Checked-law channel: 3.3x over the obvious fold; false laws refuted at
  compile time (the W3 jewel — expert Rust's manual reassociation is an
  unchecked assertion).
- Effect-attr channel: LTO-grade cross-module optimization at per-file build
  cost; guarantee-vs-heuristic; survives truly opaque boundaries.
- Scoped-alias channel: short-trip wins + 17x code size vs guard-versioned
  Rust loops; parity at long trips (runtime checks amortize).
- Utility ports: wc full counts 2.1x GNU / 2.4x uutils-Rust; base64 1.6x
  GNU/uutils at RFC-identical output; both at full checked semantics.
- D9a default floor now has two independently locked shipped-library wins from
  first-green `gpt-5.6-terra` trajectories: `percent_decode` is 1.653x
  `percent-encoding` 2.3.2 [1.631, 1.667], and one-shot UTF-8 parsing is 1.098x
  `utf8parse` 0.2.2 [1.085, 1.145]. In both targets facts retain every bounds
  site, so these are default implementation-shape wins, not proof-elision
  wins. This is a replicated floor result, not a universal language claim.
- Codegen debt retired: OWN-1 Bool-copy amendment -> i1 dataflow -> C/Rust
  parity on the classifier kernel (was 1.6-1.8x behind); 2-variant enums i1.

Measured non-wins (equally load-bearing):
- Expert safe Rust reaches parity on regular base64 after iterator
  restructuring. That remains useful ceiling evidence, but D9a no longer uses
  a benchmark-specialized implementation as the primary comparator.
- The old D9 leg-A study is a **directional, non-gating pilot**, not a
  population result:
  30 popular source crates and 12 command-line applications. Manual review found
  no current checked-law or scoped-alias win. Three optimized-IR builds found
  hot surviving bounds checks in `comrak` and `inferno`; a single-check
  `comrak` intervention was byte-identical but neutral. The useful signal is a
  family of relational/precondition proofs to test in a real port. It is now
  context for generalization, not a prerequisite for the primary score.
- PROOF-2 makes facts-on base64 1.71x faster than the same facts-off source by
  discharging 27/27 indexed sites. Expert Rust can express a different shape
  that reaches parity; both facts matter, but they answer different questions.
- uutils' -l (bytecount SIMD) beats our naive scan 2-3x; GNU memchr too.
  Hand-tuned kernels remain ahead of our autovectorized naive shapes.

## 4. Active build track and ranked bets

1. **Minimal systems-capability basis / privileged gate** — RESEARCH SELECTION
   PENDING OWNER REVIEW (D14, 2026-07-15). The proposed architecture has two
   planes and one privilege boundary. One sealed stateful admission verifier per
   authenticated semantic toolchain root admits every irreducible machine,
   allocator, helper, lowering, ABI, OS, device, or foreign edge. Compiler-
   embedded and later signed entries pass the same exact current-membership,
   implementation-cone, consumer-cone, target/frame, and final-resolution
   predicate. No source keyword, attribute, module path, package, build flag,
   plugin, helper name, or cache record grants privilege. Exact certified bytes
   and explicitly trusted opaque foreign providers remain distinct outcomes.

   Above that gate, ordinary unapproved modules use one fixed public reference
   policy for proof-carrying resource protocols. The proposed semantic basis has
   six independent axes: spatial resources, place identity, lifecycle/control,
   interference and weak memory, external frames, and final loaded-code binding.
   Its common storage vocabulary is a generative byte carrier partitioned into
   checked typed places and padding space, with vacant/full state, linear move
   and release authority, exact focus, proof-only partition reshape, structural
   `CoreCopy`, checked callables/code leases, and executable static disposition.
   Opaque modules may choose dense, ring, gap, sparse, recursive, shared,
   concurrent, pinned, or external protocol metadata; no universal topology tag,
   liveness bitmap, destructor pointer, named container, or privileged standard
   library is selected. `LiveShape` is derived automation for common shapes, not
   the semantic boundary.

   The paper dossier supplies candidate architecture-level routes across all 26
   systems-domain categories and constructive witnesses for sequential growth,
   arbitrary sparse occupancy, stable recyclable identity, recursion and
   arenas, traversal and cleanup, shared/dynamic borrowing, weak-memory
   protocols, pinning, partial I/O, callbacks, async cancellation, and final
   loaded-image closure. Four independently selected held-outs cover concurrent
   cuckoo migration, crash-consistent LSM state, hot-swappable JIT code, and
   sparse GPU residency. These listed witnesses support further study; they do
   not close exact D-2 or P-1. The frozen dense dossier contributes 93 members
   and 303 exact outcomes. Its generated basis ledger is fail-closed: 340 unique
   required route obligations across 150 contexts remain unresolved. The
   disjoint partition is 168 coarse Convert-route, 24 Convert-callable, 136
   allocator-applicability, six IntoOwner ZST/capacity-reshape, and six
   IntoBoxed fullness/ZST obligations. Sixteen allocator obligations also
   implicate Convert, so 208 obligations are Convert-related in total. Every
   unresolved obligation receives no D-2 or cost credit.

   The performance position is a candidate hypothesis, not a completed P-1
   result: the architecture is intended to permit contract-selected payload
   layout, metadata, allocation, indirection, ownership traffic, and asymptotic
   algorithms without a universal container tax. Exact same-contract parity is
   still pending for route multiplicity, allocator applicability, Rotate
   dispatch, stable-sort scheduling, and cached-key sorting. Proof erasure and
   P-2 through P-4 remain architecture-level claims only. No throughput, code-
   size, compile-time, proof-size, automatic-proof, or default-writer result is
   claimed.

   Owner review is now the next decision. Ratification would select only this
   architecture for further research and would keep exact D-2 and P-1 pending.
   It would not authorize a language/specification change, compiler
   implementation, capability entry, standard library, container candidate,
   E0.1 restart, xlc migration, benchmark, or default teaching. Before any
   combined D14 completion claim, direction-specific Convert contracts,
   allocator applicability, ZST/full-storage subcontracts, Rotate dispatch, and
   stable/cached-key sort schedules must be resolved independently. If ratified,
   the smallest separately authorized implementation-oriented study is a
   formalization research lock for the sequential R-1/R-2/R-3 kernel,
   `CoreCopy`, reshape, exact focus, opaque sealing, allocation outcomes, and
   disposition. Weak-memory profile selection and surface syntax remain later
   independent decisions.
2. **xlc self-hosting build track** — ACTIVE BUILD TRACK. The production compiler
   now parses, validates, indexes, and resolves all types in its own 477-function
   unit. The first S1 baseline is established: a pure whole-unit semantic driver
   deterministically reports 15 clean, 462 legal-unsupported, and zero semantic
   rejects, with the first source-order frontier at `lexer_scan_op_suffix`.
   Legal non-profile functions are no longer misreported as type errors, and the
   existing 15-function LLVM module remains byte-identical. E0 is now an ordered
   five-part expressiveness validation: flat data layout/owning sequences; closed-unit
   modules, inherent impl and static contracts; borrowed aggregates plus
   fact-carrying loops/range match; byte constants/bulk append; and typed SIMD
   with target dispatch. Exactly one part runs at a time, beginning with the
   current SoA-vs-AoS/owning-sequence question. Each part freezes a factorial
   protocol, preserves unchanged-source code shape, measures default-writer
   selection where applicable, and receives hostile review before any language
   change. The earlier local-own/Bool-if/formatting observations are parked as
   surface costs, not treated as evidence of lost performance. After those five
   decisions, the next S1 slice adds an acyclic-decision semantic family for
   `lexer_scan_op_suffix` plus `lexer_scan_word`, without adding lowering; later
   slices extend copy-scalar, type, ownership, and effect rules across the
   remaining functions. The staged route continues through whole-unit lowering,
   a stage-1 compiler, and the byte-identical self-hosting fixpoint; every slice
   keeps both repository gates green. **E0.1 status (2026-07-13):** the first
   detached record-buffer prototype is rejected but durably archived; owner choice
   among automatic structural Copy, declarative `copy struct`, and nominally affine
   record storage is reopened, so no production design is selected. Independently
   authorized current-language conformance repairs close the checker drift at
   `7438e17` and parser drift at `50a1ddd`. Strict GRAM-9 required 744 additional
   bindings in the
   self-hosted compiler source, but the isolated whole-compiler optimized object is
   byte-identical (264,288 bytes, SHA-256
   `eef9c30193b69be22452f47bc8050453f5da9d86454ff165c74da0be6241b522`). The MCTS-Mem
   design tree remains unchanged until the owner selects a production route.
   The paired E0.1 ownership screen must not enter Lock A. Any later dense-family
   Lock A must explicitly retain, revise, or supersede every relevant E0.1 arm
   and measurement; the fixed builder and declarative-Copy arms do not cover the
   general sequence, sparse-slot, or deletion/reuse contracts. G0-Core alone is
   not candidate authorization.
3. **Default-floor experiment against shipped Rust (D9a)** — COMPLETE on two
   separately preregistered targets. First-green Terra xlang records paired
   throughput ratios of 1.653x [1.631, 1.667] against `percent-encoding` 2.3.2
   and 1.098x [1.085, 1.145] against one-shot `utf8parse` 0.2.2. Both retain
   every reported xlang bounds site, so neither is a proof-elision win. This is
   cross-target performance-floor evidence, not a pooled ecosystem result or
   expert-Rust ceiling claim. Canonical wording and caveats are in
   `experiments/default-floor/RESULTS.md`; no third target is required for D9a.
4. **Proof-elided checks (OP-4 tier)** — enabling evidence for the experiment.
   A checked concrete-function `requires` prologue
   computes and verifies a boundary fact once at callee entry, then the
   deterministic prover uses it to elide dominated implicit checks that LLVM
   cannot derive locally. Calls remain legal without caller proof; writers
   keep `.trap` semantics and the compiler earns the speed. Evidence already
   filed: provably-safe trap
   reductions stay scalar; ~18 surviving bounds branches block base64
   vectorization (controlled elision experiment designed in gates, no gain
   claimed until run). This is also the principled answer to "bad code
   exists": never push writers to `.wrap`. STATUS 2026-07-10: ceiling
   MEASURED — 1.7x on base64 (scalar; no SIMD unlock), design card in gates;
   PROOF-1 now proves exact len-guarded indexes, fixed-stride remainder-loop
   offsets/tails, and masked const-array indexes through unsigned widening.
   Its 50-case per-site corpus gates 18 positives, one mixed classification,
   and 31 adversarial/conservative near-misses. On base64 it discharges 15/27
   sites and measures 2.50 -> 2.93 GB/s (1.17x), recovering 36% of the
   perfect-prover time gap; all 12 remaining sites are output-capacity writes.
   PROOF-2 was owner-approved and implemented 2026-07-11 as the concrete-only
   checked `requires { let_stmt* check_stmt }` first slice (FN-8); its semantics
   are selected and its spelling remains R3-provisional. The checked 3:4
   capacity relation plus i=3k/o=4k proof discharges base64 27/27 sites, reaches
   the perfect-index-elision ceiling (77 instructions, one retained entry trap),
   and measures 2.480 -> 4.233 GB/s (1.71x). The combined bounds corpus is 94
   cases: 50 PROOF-1 plus 44 PROOF-2 capacity/lockstep cases, including alias,
   mutation, relation, stride, ordering, and tail adversaries. Contract
   refinement remains deferred; prototype artifact-embedded proof references,
   gated FFI frames, and machine-readable trap reports remain explicit debt.
   FIRST REVIEWED SLICE IMPLEMENTED 2026-07-11: PROOF-2 now derives its
   obligation from the body before independently normalizing `requires`, emits
   deterministic first-missing-fact / first-failed-premise site diagnostics,
   and gates those diagnostics in both facts modes across all 44 cases. The
   reporting path is byte-transparent in 190/190 report/no-report compilations
   over all 95 corpus `.xl` files in both facts modes. CHECKED-AUTOMATION
   BOUNDS-V1 IMPLEMENTED 2026-07-11: the facts-on site report carries complete
   schema-versioned analyzer provenance; the B2 classifier passes proved and
   affirmatively intrinsic-dynamic sites, fails
   missing/mismatched obligations as hard findings, and fails every
   indeterminate state closed. The unfilterable `--promotion` invocation
   dual-pins base64's source/function/digest and checks its whole compilation
   unit (27 automatically accounted, zero findings). Fifteen review-pinned corpus policy
   oracles, including the n27–n33 syntax/alias frontier, plus 21 unit tests
   separate diagnostic regression maturity from bounds-v1 build evaluation.
   This is an authorization-free enforcement slice: approvals remain forbidden
   until per-site dependency-cone identity exists, backend credit and
   explicit-check enforcement are absent,
   and protected external owner review must govern coordinated changes to both
   repository pins. The subgate is not canonical DIAG-2 or complete artifact
   promotion. Guard versioning and variable-output work remain staged by
   `optimizer-language-research/implementation/requires-check-accounting-REVIEW.md`;
   no normative language rule changed.
5. **Leg-A frequency pilot** — complete; stop building analysis infrastructure.
   Raw source heuristics substantially overcounted alias and saturating-law
   opportunities, while optimized `comrak` exposed many surviving checks in
   genuinely hot parser paths. The pilot therefore redirects the next bounded
   experiment toward generalized relational/precondition proof in one real
   workload. It does not clear D9, estimate ecosystem prevalence, or justify
   further frequency-tool investment.
6. **Channel 4: blessed interpreter dispatch** (carded): lower naive
   loop+match to threaded/musttail dispatch — structural delta over Rust,
   parity with expert C from the obvious shape. Eventual benchmark: the
   owner's own engine (Silverfir), owner-refereed.
7. **Coreutils ladder** (D7a): wc, base64 done; next utilities need the I/O
   frame (first D4 FFI instance) and chunked-driver parity. The AI-authorship
   headline runs through the shelved trial harness when the time comes.

STATUS UPDATE (2026-07-13): D9a is complete on two separately preregistered
targets. Default Terra xlang beats shipped `percent-encoding` 2.3.2 by 1.653x
and shipped `utf8parse` 0.2.2 by 1.098x on their locked workloads. Neither win
comes from proof-elided bounds checks. This supports a replicated default-shape
thesis while remaining limited to these implementations, corpora, and machine.
THE BUILD TRACK IS ACTIVE: `compiler/` hosts xlc, the production compiler
written in xlang itself (the current baseline remains the P2 SoA-tape
architecture with fixed-capacity buffers and no generics), bootstrapped by
prototype/democ as stage 0,
with its own gate (`make -C compiler check`, incl. the self-parse gate).

## 5. The pivot clause (pre-registered)

The primary outcome is scored exactly once on the frozen first-green
artifact. If it does not beat the shipped Rust baseline outside the
pre-registered equivalence band, the default-floor hypothesis is unsupported
for this task; do not rescue it with human tuning, a stronger model, or expert
Rust. If it wins, pre-register and run a second shipped-library task before
claiming a general performance-floor effect. A ceiling result from expert Rust
does not erase a default-floor win, and a facts-off result determines whether
the measured source of the win was proof elision or another taught/forced
shape. If the default path repeatedly ties or loses, the honest pitch becomes:
**C-class speed with everything checked, everything reproducible, written by
AI under a checker that makes cheating unrepresentable** — safety-at-parity
plus floor-raising plus build economics, not "faster than Rust." R0's fallback
options (verified-facts frontend; linted-Rust) get a fair hearing. That outcome
changes the pitch, not the honesty; it is a finding, not a failure.

## 6. Standing process rules

- Durability: commit + gates line per completed step (rewind-proof).
- Codegen parity is an explicit verification layer: deterministic earned
  properties gate every `make check`; unresolved targets remain visible audits
  until independently verified and promoted (`CODEGEN-PARITY.md`).
- Fact channels get adversarial review BEFORE ship (the willreturn lesson:
  green checks missed a real unsoundness; the refutation attempt caught it).
- Agent tiering: sonnet floor for mechanical work, opus for most fan-outs,
  top tier only for subtle soundness/design (owner ruling).
- Claims discipline: verifiers before headlines; report the number that
  survives adversarial review, with the caveat attached.
- Safe-direction framing: performance and correctness language only.
- Repository language: every repository-resident artifact and filename uses
  English only (D10); translated duplicates and language-suffixed reports are
  forbidden.
