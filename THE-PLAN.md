# THE PLAN (consolidated 2026-07-13)

The single current-state document: what this project believes, what it has
proven, and what it does next. Supersedes the DECISION_SPRINT/ROADMAP phase plans
(kept in archive/). Law lives in CONSTITUTION.md; rulings in
`optimizer-language-research/notes/user-directives.md`; the lab notebook in
`optimizer-language-research/implementation/decision-gates.md`. This file is
the map, re-derived from those sources; on conflict, they win in that order.

## 1. What xlang is

A systems language for AI-written, human-approved code (D0a). Entire bug
classes are unrepresentable (memory corruption, races, silent overflow,
uninitialized reads — T1/T2/D1) via an ownership/region/effects checker with
no unsafe escape (W3). The checker's proofs double as optimizer facts (P0).
One canonical spelling per program (FORM-1/2). The spec fits in a context
window (D2 — still binding per owner: context is the resource that survives
model scaling). Design patterns are a closed, taught catalog, at architecture
scale as at statement scale (D6, PATTERNS.md).

## 2. Standing rulings (digest — full text in user-directives.md)

- D0a AI-authored, human-approved. D1a simple checker: reject-when-unsure.
- D2a spec compactness binds; program verbosity does not.
- D3 never copy Rust by default; lexicon names checked invariants.
- D4 rewrite-first, FFI-narrow.
- D5 broad model-tier writer sprint deprioritized; D9a narrowly requires one
  fixed low-tier run to measure the production default path.
- D6 pattern doctrine: catalog must be complete AND efficient; taught, not
  discovered.
- D7/D7a impact target: swap-in everyday artifacts; headline formula is
  faster + parity + bug-class-unrepresentable + AI-authored. Safe-direction
  constraint: performance/correctness framing only.
- D9a confidence gate: compare one fixed `gpt-5.6-terra`/medium model's first
  correctness-green xlang artifact with one exact, unmodified, commonly used
  shipped Rust library. Freeze before timing; facts-on/off explains the win.
  Expert Rust is ceiling evidence only. Replicate once before a broad claim.

## 3. Evidence to date — honest ledger

Measured wins (real, replicable, with caveats in each RESULTS.md):
- Floor-raising (binary-trees): the slow design is unrepresentable; ports
  land on the fast shape by construction. The 12x-vs-Box number is a shape
  effect — identical-shape Rust is ~11% faster than us (checked-semantics
  tax, part of which is xlang doing MORE checking than release Rust).
- Checked-law channel: 3.3x over the obvious fold; false laws refuted at
  compile time (the W3 jewel — expert Rust's manual reassociation is an
  unchecked assertion).
- Effect-attr channel: LTO-grade cross-module optimization at per-file build
  cost; guarantee-vs-heuristic; survives truly opaque boundaries.
- Scoped-alias channel: short-trip wins + 17x code size vs guard-versioned
  Rust loops; parity at long trips (runtime checks amortize).
- Utility ports: wc full counts 2.1x GNU / 2.4x uutils-Rust; base64 1.6x
  GNU/uutils at RFC-identical output; both at full checked semantics.
- D9a default floor now has two independently locked shipped-library wins from
  first-green `gpt-5.6-terra` trajectories: `percent_decode` is 1.653x
  `percent-encoding` 2.3.2 [1.631, 1.667], and one-shot UTF-8 parsing is 1.098x
  `utf8parse` 0.2.2 [1.085, 1.145]. In both targets facts retain every bounds
  site, so these are default implementation-shape wins, not proof-elision
  wins. This is a replicated floor result, not a universal language claim.
- Codegen debt retired: OWN-1 Bool-copy amendment -> i1 dataflow -> C/Rust
  parity on the classifier kernel (was 1.6-1.8x behind); 2-variant enums i1.

Measured non-wins (equally load-bearing):
- Expert safe Rust reaches parity on regular base64 after iterator
  restructuring. That remains useful ceiling evidence, but D9a no longer uses
  a benchmark-specialized implementation as the primary comparator.
- The old D9 leg-A study is a **directional, non-gating pilot**, not a
  population result:
  30 popular source crates and 12 command-line applications. Manual review found
  no current checked-law or scoped-alias win. Three optimized-IR builds found
  hot surviving bounds checks in `comrak` and `inferno`; a single-check
  `comrak` intervention was byte-identical but neutral. The useful signal is a
  family of relational/precondition proofs to test in a real port. It is now
  context for generalization, not a prerequisite for the primary score.
- PROOF-2 makes facts-on base64 1.71x faster than the same facts-off source by
  discharging 27/27 indexed sites. Expert Rust can express a different shape
  that reaches parity; both facts matter, but they answer different questions.
- uutils' -l (bytecount SIMD) beats our naive scan 2-3x; GNU memchr too.
  Hand-tuned kernels remain ahead of our autovectorized naive shapes.

## 4. Active build track and ranked bets

1. **General-purpose data-structure capability floor** — OWNER-REVIEWED
   RESEARCH BOUNDARY; NEXT WORK NOT YET AUTHORIZED. D11 confirms the eventual
   general-purpose target and corrects the earlier monolithic G0 proposal. The
   bounded G0-Core freezes only the global registry, coarse observable and
   asymptotic contracts, safety/no-tax laws, family dependencies, reopening
   rules, holdout identities, and later-gate schemas. Exact algorithms,
   workloads, thresholds, soundness fixtures, and META-5 derivations freeze in
   a Family Lock A immediately before that family's candidate work. Dense
   affine sequence is first because it has the broadest dependency surface, not
   because xlc has already selected a growable representation. A family that
   passes its complete evidence gate may seek separate owner-approved adoption;
   the full capability-floor claim waits for all protected B baselines and
   mandatory M, W, and H obligations. E0.1 remains suspended before Lock A, and
   its old fixed-record paired protocol does not restart automatically. No
   G0-Core work, syntax, substrate, candidate or production implementation,
   specification change, xlc migration, scored run, or default teaching has
   been authorized. The next step is an owner discussion.
2. **xlc self-hosting build track** — ACTIVE BUILD TRACK. The production compiler
   now parses, validates, indexes, and resolves all types in its own 477-function
   unit. The first S1 baseline is established: a pure whole-unit semantic driver
   deterministically reports 15 clean, 462 legal-unsupported, and zero semantic
   rejects, with the first source-order frontier at `lexer_scan_op_suffix`.
   Legal non-profile functions are no longer misreported as type errors, and the
   existing 15-function LLVM module remains byte-identical. E0 is now an ordered
   five-part expressiveness validation: flat data layout/owning sequences; closed-unit
   modules, inherent impl and static contracts; borrowed aggregates plus
   fact-carrying loops/range match; byte constants/bulk append; and typed SIMD
   with target dispatch. Exactly one part runs at a time, beginning with the
   current SoA-vs-AoS/owning-sequence question. Each part freezes a factorial
   protocol, preserves unchanged-source code shape, measures default-writer
   selection where applicable, and receives hostile review before any language
   change. The earlier local-own/Bool-if/formatting observations are parked as
   surface costs, not treated as evidence of lost performance. After those five
   decisions, the next S1 slice adds an acyclic-decision semantic family for
   `lexer_scan_op_suffix` plus `lexer_scan_word`, without adding lowering; later
   slices extend copy-scalar, type, ownership, and effect rules across the
   remaining functions. The staged route continues through whole-unit lowering,
   a stage-1 compiler, and the byte-identical self-hosting fixpoint; every slice
   keeps both repository gates green. **E0.1 status (2026-07-13):** the first
   detached record-buffer prototype is rejected but durably archived; owner choice
   among automatic structural Copy, declarative `copy struct`, and nominally affine
   record storage is reopened, so no production design is selected. Independently
   authorized current-language conformance repairs close the checker drift at
   `7438e17` and parser drift at `50a1ddd`. Strict GRAM-9 required 744 additional
   bindings in the
   self-hosted compiler source, but the isolated whole-compiler optimized object is
   byte-identical (264,288 bytes, SHA-256
   `eef9c30193b69be22452f47bc8050453f5da9d86454ff165c74da0be6241b522`). The MCTS-Mem
   design tree remains unchanged until the owner selects a production route.
   The paired E0.1 ownership screen must not enter Lock A. Any later dense-family
   Lock A must explicitly retain, revise, or supersede every relevant E0.1 arm
   and measurement; the fixed builder and declarative-Copy arms do not cover the
   general sequence, sparse-slot, or deletion/reuse contracts. G0-Core alone is
   not candidate authorization.
3. **Default-floor experiment against shipped Rust (D9a)** — COMPLETE on two
   separately preregistered targets. First-green Terra xlang records paired
   throughput ratios of 1.653x [1.631, 1.667] against `percent-encoding` 2.3.2
   and 1.098x [1.085, 1.145] against one-shot `utf8parse` 0.2.2. Both retain
   every reported xlang bounds site, so neither is a proof-elision win. This is
   cross-target performance-floor evidence, not a pooled ecosystem result or
   expert-Rust ceiling claim. Canonical wording and caveats are in
   `experiments/default-floor/RESULTS.md`; no third target is required for D9a.
4. **Proof-elided checks (OP-4 tier)** — enabling evidence for the experiment.
   A checked concrete-function `requires` prologue
   computes and verifies a boundary fact once at callee entry, then the
   deterministic prover uses it to elide dominated implicit checks that LLVM
   cannot derive locally. Calls remain legal without caller proof; writers
   keep `.trap` semantics and the compiler earns the speed. Evidence already
   filed: provably-safe trap
   reductions stay scalar; ~18 surviving bounds branches block base64
   vectorization (controlled elision experiment designed in gates, no gain
   claimed until run). This is also the principled answer to "bad code
   exists": never push writers to `.wrap`. STATUS 2026-07-10: ceiling
   MEASURED — 1.7x on base64 (scalar; no SIMD unlock), design card in gates;
   PROOF-1 now proves exact len-guarded indexes, fixed-stride remainder-loop
   offsets/tails, and masked const-array indexes through unsigned widening.
   Its 50-case per-site corpus gates 18 positives, one mixed classification,
   and 31 adversarial/conservative near-misses. On base64 it discharges 15/27
   sites and measures 2.50 -> 2.93 GB/s (1.17x), recovering 36% of the
   perfect-prover time gap; all 12 remaining sites are output-capacity writes.
   PROOF-2 was owner-approved and implemented 2026-07-11 as the concrete-only
   checked `requires { let_stmt* check_stmt }` first slice (FN-8); its semantics
   are selected and its spelling remains R3-provisional. The checked 3:4
   capacity relation plus i=3k/o=4k proof discharges base64 27/27 sites, reaches
   the perfect-index-elision ceiling (77 instructions, one retained entry trap),
   and measures 2.480 -> 4.233 GB/s (1.71x). The combined bounds corpus is 94
   cases: 50 PROOF-1 plus 44 PROOF-2 capacity/lockstep cases, including alias,
   mutation, relation, stride, ordering, and tail adversaries. Contract
   refinement remains deferred; prototype artifact-embedded proof references,
   gated FFI frames, and machine-readable trap reports remain explicit debt.
   FIRST REVIEWED SLICE IMPLEMENTED 2026-07-11: PROOF-2 now derives its
   obligation from the body before independently normalizing `requires`, emits
   deterministic first-missing-fact / first-failed-premise site diagnostics,
   and gates those diagnostics in both facts modes across all 44 cases. The
   reporting path is byte-transparent in 190/190 report/no-report compilations
   over all 95 corpus `.xl` files in both facts modes. CHECKED-AUTOMATION
   BOUNDS-V1 IMPLEMENTED 2026-07-11: the facts-on site report carries complete
   schema-versioned analyzer provenance; the B2 classifier passes proved and
   affirmatively intrinsic-dynamic sites, fails
   missing/mismatched obligations as hard findings, and fails every
   indeterminate state closed. The unfilterable `--promotion` invocation
   dual-pins base64's source/function/digest and checks its whole compilation
   unit (27 automatically accounted, zero findings). Fifteen review-pinned corpus policy
   oracles, including the n27–n33 syntax/alias frontier, plus 21 unit tests
   separate diagnostic regression maturity from bounds-v1 build evaluation.
   This is an authorization-free enforcement slice: approvals remain forbidden
   until per-site dependency-cone identity exists, backend credit and
   explicit-check enforcement are absent,
   and protected external owner review must govern coordinated changes to both
   repository pins. The subgate is not canonical DIAG-2 or complete artifact
   promotion. Guard versioning and variable-output work remain staged by
   `optimizer-language-research/implementation/requires-check-accounting-REVIEW.md`;
   no normative language rule changed.
5. **Leg-A frequency pilot** — complete; stop building analysis infrastructure.
   Raw source heuristics substantially overcounted alias and saturating-law
   opportunities, while optimized `comrak` exposed many surviving checks in
   genuinely hot parser paths. The pilot therefore redirects the next bounded
   experiment toward generalized relational/precondition proof in one real
   workload. It does not clear D9, estimate ecosystem prevalence, or justify
   further frequency-tool investment.
6. **Channel 4: blessed interpreter dispatch** (carded): lower naive
   loop+match to threaded/musttail dispatch — structural delta over Rust,
   parity with expert C from the obvious shape. Eventual benchmark: the
   owner's own engine (Silverfir), owner-refereed.
7. **Coreutils ladder** (D7a): wc, base64 done; next utilities need the I/O
   frame (first D4 FFI instance) and chunked-driver parity. The AI-authorship
   headline runs through the shelved trial harness when the time comes.

STATUS UPDATE (2026-07-13): D9a is complete on two separately preregistered
targets. Default Terra xlang beats shipped `percent-encoding` 2.3.2 by 1.653x
and shipped `utf8parse` 0.2.2 by 1.098x on their locked workloads. Neither win
comes from proof-elided bounds checks. This supports a replicated default-shape
thesis while remaining limited to these implementations, corpora, and machine.
THE BUILD TRACK IS ACTIVE: `compiler/` hosts xlc, the production compiler
written in xlang itself (the current baseline remains the P2 SoA-tape
architecture with fixed-capacity buffers and no generics), bootstrapped by
prototype/democ as stage 0,
with its own gate (`make -C compiler check`, incl. the self-parse gate).

## 5. The pivot clause (pre-registered)

The primary outcome is scored exactly once on the frozen first-green
artifact. If it does not beat the shipped Rust baseline outside the
pre-registered equivalence band, the default-floor hypothesis is unsupported
for this task; do not rescue it with human tuning, a stronger model, or expert
Rust. If it wins, pre-register and run a second shipped-library task before
claiming a general performance-floor effect. A ceiling result from expert Rust
does not erase a default-floor win, and a facts-off result determines whether
the measured source of the win was proof elision or another taught/forced
shape. If the default path repeatedly ties or loses, the honest pitch becomes:
**C-class speed with everything checked, everything reproducible, written by
AI under a checker that makes cheating unrepresentable** — safety-at-parity
plus floor-raising plus build economics, not "faster than Rust." R0's fallback
options (verified-facts frontend; linted-Rust) get a fair hearing. That outcome
changes the pitch, not the honesty; it is a finding, not a failure.

## 6. Standing process rules

- Durability: commit + gates line per completed step (rewind-proof).
- Codegen parity is an explicit verification layer: deterministic earned
  properties gate every `make check`; unresolved targets remain visible audits
  until independently verified and promoted (`CODEGEN-PARITY.md`).
- Fact channels get adversarial review BEFORE ship (the willreturn lesson:
  green checks missed a real unsoundness; the refutation attempt caught it).
- Agent tiering: sonnet floor for mechanical work, opus for most fan-outs,
  top tier only for subtle soundness/design (owner ruling).
- Claims discipline: verifiers before headlines; report the number that
  survives adversarial review, with the caveat attached.
- Safe-direction framing: performance and correctness language only.
- Repository language: every repository-resident artifact and filename uses
  English only (D10); translated duplicates and language-suffixed reports are
  forbidden.
