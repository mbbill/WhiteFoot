# THE PLAN

Status: CANONICAL ROADMAP, updated 2026-07-17.

This file contains Whitefoot's one current execution order. Other files may
define law, specify behavior, explain a design, or preserve evidence. They do
not set current priority or authorize work.

## Authority and scope

- `CONSTITUTION.md` defines project law.
- `optimizer-language-research/notes/user-directives.md` records owner rulings.
- `spec/kernel-spec-v0.8.md` defines the accepted language.
- `PATTERNS.md` defines the closed set of forms writers use.
- This file orders implementation and records its authorization boundary.
- `optimizer-language-research/implementation/decision-gates.md` preserves the
  append-only evidence log. `mcts_mem/` preserves design reasons and rejected
  alternatives.

If these sources disagree, stop at the conflict and reconcile the governing
source and this roadmap in one change. A research result, handover, follow-up
list, design dossier, archived plan, or MCTS alternative cannot authorize work.

On 2026-07-17 the owner directed the project to consolidate its plan files and
complete phases 1 through 7 below. That direction authorizes each phase after
its predecessor passes its exit gate. Phase 1 completed on 2026-07-17; phase 2
is active. The authorized scope ends with the first production `seq` component.
It excludes every later
container, checked-source library, public I/O or FFI surface, compiler
migration, and concurrency feature.

A failed correctness gate returns work to the first phase that owns the defect.
A phase cannot borrow a future artifact to satisfy its gate.

Every reproducible defect or discrepancy gets the smallest practical automated
regression before its fix closes. Language and specification discrepancies use
conformance cases; implementation defects use focused unit or integration
tests; hostile boundary failures also pin failure atomicity and guard behavior.
If automation is not practical, the decision log records the reproducer and why
the gate cannot execute it yet.

## Measured baseline

Baseline date: 2026-07-17, before plan consolidation.

- The wfc unit contains 32 Whitefoot files, 24,695 lines, and 477 functions.
  Concatenation in `sources.txt` order produces 1,095,342 source bytes, 217,254
  tokens, and 109,235 unique-head AST nodes.
- wfc lexes, parses, validates, indexes, resolves declarations and types, and
  builds function scopes for that complete unit. Two parses produce identical
  token and AST tapes.
- Body semantics classify 15 functions as clean, 462 as legal but unsupported,
  and zero as semantic rejects. The first source-order frontier is
  `lexer_scan_op_suffix`.
- LLVM support emits the same 15 clean functions as one deterministic module.
  Clang accepts it and the native tests pass.
- `wfc_frontend_run` is the current external seam. The complete `wfc_compile`
  path, a stage-1 compiler, and a self-hosting fixpoint do not exist yet.
- wfc uses fixed-capacity structure-of-arrays tapes backed by primitive
  buffers. Source size bounds each tape. Bootstrap needs no growable
  collection, pool, generic container, or thread.
- Stage 0 is `prototype/democ`. It compiles wfc with optimizer facts disabled.
  The current v0.6 implementation and conformance suite provide the independent
  behavior oracle while wfc catches up.
- The systems-capability research package has finished. Its 15-rule loan/freeze
  design passed a 97-program machine corpus and all nine mutation tests. Its
  `seq` operation table and dry run provide landing evidence. None of that work
  has changed the production specification or compiler.
- `make check` and `make -C compiler check` passed at the baseline commit.

## Phase 1: establish one roadmap

**Entry:** the 2026-07-17 owner direction above.

Work:

1. Move the live compiler sequence from `compiler/PLAN.md` into this file.
   Preserve architecture in `compiler/README.md` and `mcts_mem/`; remove the
   duplicate plan.
2. Move `HANDOVER.md` and the completed validation-harness plan into `archive/`.
   Fold unresolved production prerequisites from the capability follow-up list
   into the relevant gates below, then remove that list.
3. Replace dated current-focus material in `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` with a
   pointer here. Keep those two files byte-identical.
4. Add a root check that rejects another plan-named file, a second canonical
   roadmap marker, a retired active path, or a duplicate current-focus section.
   Historical plans may remain under `archive/` and rejected alternatives may
   remain under `mcts_mem/**.alt/`.
5. Correct stale counts, decisions, and authorization statements in active
   documentation. Preserve completed protocols and archived evidence unchanged.

**Exit gate:** this file is the sole active roadmap. The structural check
rejects competing roadmap markers and retired paths; review confirms that no
other active document defines execution order. Both project gates pass. The
change has one commit and one decision-log entry.

## Phase 2: self-host the compiler subset with facts off

**Entry:** phase 1 exit.

Execute these steps in order:

1. **Complete body semantics.** Grow wfc's type, ownership, loan, and effect
   checks until it classifies every function in the exact `sources.txt` unit.
   Its rejection ABI records one rule ID, canonical node path, primary and
   related nodes, source span, and an applicable mechanical fix code.
   Add one structural capability family per slice. Compare every covered
   conformance case and the whole compiler unit with stage 0. Resolve each
   verdict difference as a wfc defect or a stage-0 defect backed by a new
   conformance case.
2. **Complete whole-unit lowering.** Start after body-semantics coverage reaches
   the full unit. Grow the shared fact-driven LLVM families until
   `wfc_compile(sources)` emits every function. Clang must accept the complete
   module, and native tests must exercise it.
3. **Run compiler-subset conformance through stage 1.** Add a wfc adapter to the
   conformance runner. Require zero verdict differences for the language subset
   wfc's source uses.
4. **Reach the facts-off fixpoint.** Build wfc1 with stage 0; compile the unit to
   IR2 and build wfc2; compile the same unit to IR3. Require byte-identical
   `IR2 == IR3`. Freeze stage 0 at this point. Keep it as a differential oracle,
   but add no language feature to it.

New helper functions change the unit total, so each slice regenerates and pins
the exact count. Facts remain disabled throughout this phase.

**No-reborrow decision — RESOLVED (2026-07-18): bounded statement-scoped reborrow,
landed in v0.7.** Growing body semantics surfaced that wfc's own source reborrows
at ~1,062 verified sites — it borrows a sub-place of an exclusive `&uniq` holder
and passes it onward as a call argument (e.g. `frontend_unit_reset` forms
`&uniq 'frontend_reset_tokens deref(analyzed).tokens`), which v0.6 forbade. The
owner-directed investigation (`optimizer-language-research/implementation/
reborrow-investigation/`) weighed keeping the rule and rewriting the code against
relaxing it, on written pros and cons, a Featherweight-Rust reconciliation, a
1,000,000-program model-check (zero aliasing), and a hostile no-alias fact-channel
review (PASS-WITH-CONDITIONS; performance preserved). The owner ratified the narrow
relaxation, and kernel-spec **v0.7** admits the bounded, non-escaping,
statement-scoped child reborrow (OWN-5/6/9/12 + new STOR-5) while deferring
result-transfer and the harder forms. What remains in Phase 2 is production
implementation of an already-landed spec rule, not a new spec decision: implement
the fragment in the production checker with the recorded conditions, and grow wfc
body semantics and lowering so every reborrowing function classifies clean and
lowers — no function may remain unsupported at the Phase 2 exit.

**Exit gate:** the exact compiler unit has complete body semantics and lowering;
stage-1 wfc matches stage 0 on compiler-subset conformance; the facts-off IR
fixpoint is byte-identical; both project gates pass.

## Phase 3: implement all of v0.8 with facts off

**Entry:** phase 2 exit and a frozen stage 0.

Implement every accepted v0.8 construct that wfc's own source did not require.
The work includes `requires`: AST representation, parsing, entry-check
normalization, body-derived obligation accounting, deterministic diagnostics,
lowering, and report/no-report byte identity. Complete effect checking before
any optimizer fact can affect output.

Run the full v0.8 conformance suite through wfc. Use frozen stage 0 as the
behavior oracle only for its frozen subset. Use specification-derived expected
artifacts or purpose-built reference checkers for constructs stage 0 lacks.
Resolve all fourteen pending source cases so the runner reports zero skips.
Implement executable DIAG-2 elaborated-artifact and DIAG-3 report-schema gates;
annotations do not close those rules. Preserve a conformance case for each
discrepancy. Keep facts disabled and rerun the facts-off self-hosting fixpoint
after the final language slice.

**Exit gate:** wfc accepts and rejects every source-emittable v0.8 case with
zero skips, supports `requires` end to end, emits the DIAG-2 artifact and DIAG-3
reports, completes effect checking, and retains the facts-off byte-identical
fixpoint. Both project gates pass.

## Phase 4: enable fact channels and finish the compiler baseline

**Entry:** phase 3 exit.

For each fact family, freeze its proposition, provenance, producer, consumer,
invalidators, and per-site accounting before enabling it. Add observational
reports first. Require report/no-report output identity. Then enable one family,
run its facts-off control, inspect generated IR and assembly, and obtain hostile
review before shipping that family.

Require wfc to match the reference proof accounting on the bounds corpus and
all codegen-parity pins. Re-run full conformance in both fact modes and
establish a byte-identical facts-on self-hosting fixpoint.

Finish the compiler boundary in this phase: remove intentional compiler-owned
allocation leaks, retain deterministic diagnostics, harden `wfc_compile`, and
provide the trusted launcher shim. The launcher shim does not define public
file-I/O language semantics.

**Exit gate:** wfc passes full v0.8 conformance, codegen parity, per-site proof
accounting, resource cleanup, and byte-identical self-hosting with facts on.
Every fact family has hostile-review evidence. Both project gates pass. wfc is
the production compiler baseline; frozen stage 0 remains an oracle.

## Phase 5: freeze the production landing contract

**Entry:** phase 4 exit. The owner authorization at the top of this file opens
this phase without another scope decision.

Convert the sequential projection of the ratified loan/freeze research and all
24 `seq` rows into one implementation packet. Freeze exact grammar, judgments,
diagnostics, lowering, facts and invalidators, operation rows, trap behavior,
drop order, failure behavior, target mapping, and artifact hashes. Resolve every
open flag that loan/freeze or `seq` consumes.
Honor the selected explicit `copy struct` design; infer no structural copy. Add
that feature only if the frozen `seq` rows require composite Copy in phase 7.
Resolve ALLOC-ERR through a recorded owner ruling before freezing any allocating
row. The recommended rule makes environmental allocation failure a `Result`,
preserves every owned input on the error arm, and keeps capacity overflow as a
programmer-error trap.

Freeze a corpus adapter before production checking. Classify each research AST
case as source-translated, verdict-only abstract semantics, or deferred
concurrency. Define sealed signature stubs with no runtime authority for the
abstract cases, map research rule IDs to production IDs, and exclude trusted
`body=None` entries from source-conformance credit.

Define the five acceptance legs against one frozen artifact and a named Linux
x86-64 host, compiler, allocator, reference-library version, and workload.
Preregister model bounds, differential and fuzz seeds, run budgets, sanitizers,
fault schedules, review severities, sample counts, statistical bands, teardown,
and resource ceilings. Provision that runner before phase 5 exits; Apple M4 dry
runs provide design evidence but do not satisfy the deploy gate.

Keep `prototype/democ` frozen. Use the 15-rule research checker as the
independent loan/freeze oracle; wfc owns production semantics. Record this
division in the design tree and specification derivation ledger. Hostile review
must attack the packet before implementation begins.

**Exit gate:** the packet contains no open semantic flag, no dependency on a
later component, an owner-ratified ALLOC-ERR policy, a complete corpus adapter,
all 24 `seq` rows, executable pass and fail bands, a provisioned deploy runner,
and a passing hostile landing review. Both project gates pass.

## Phase 6: land sequential loan/freeze without a container

**Entry:** phase 5 exit.

Land rules R1 through R13 and the sequential part of R15, plus confined
borrow-carrying values, across the production specification, wfc parser and AST,
checker, diagnostics, lowering, conformance suite, derivation ledger, and
teaching material. Defer R14 and R15's concurrent-invocation clause with the
concurrency layer. Keep this change free of container implementation.

Run the 88 non-parallel research cases through the frozen adapter and all nine
mutation tests against the independent checker and wfc. Route source-translated
cases through the parser; route abstract cases through the verdict-only semantic
entry. Add production conformance cases for rule boundaries, invalidations,
early exits, effect interactions, and malformed internal state. Pin
unchanged-source IR and diagnostics. Obtain hostile review of the facts the new
judgment makes available to lowering. Preserve the nine parallel cases for the
later R14 landing.

**Exit gate:** wfc and the independent checker agree on all 88 sequential cases;
all applicable mutants fail as intended; full conformance and codegen parity
pass; no safety check has weakened; both project gates pass.

## Phase 7: land `seq` as the first sealed component

**Entry:** phase 6 exit and a phase-5 packet with no unresolved `seq` flag.

Implement `seq<T, N>` with inline capacity `N` as one vertical production
slice. Cover affine elements, uninitialized spare capacity, spill and growth,
take and replace, insert and remove, drain, slices, fact production and
invalidation, capacity overflow, allocation failure, drop order, and teardown.
Land its specification rows, wfc recognition and lowering, sealed
implementation, conformance cases, diagnostics, code-shape pins, and teaching
entry in the same phase.

Run all five acceptance legs across the exact 24-row surface on the same frozen
bytes:

1. differential operation testing against the reference implementation;
2. bounded state and ownership modeling;
3. sanitizer-backed fuzz and fault-injection soak;
4. hostile safety, ABI, drop, and proof-fact review;
5. Linux x86-64 performance and assembly checks, including the preregistered
   wfc-shaped tiny-vector band against SmallVec. A separate layout fixture must
   embed inline `seq` in an ordinary struct and exercise insert, remove, and
   drain. Phase 5 must define the future pool-slot fact-flow check without
   requiring a production pool implementation in this phase.

Do not migrate wfc from its structure-of-arrays tapes during this phase. Those
tapes provide the control for any later migration experiment.

**Exit gate:** all five bounded legs pass on the frozen artifact with zero
observed uninitialized reads, leaks, double drops, stale loans, missed traps, or
failure-atomicity divergences within the preregistered runs. The performance and
code-shape bands pass; both project gates pass. Stop and report completion of
the authorized seven-phase scope.

## Execution cursor

Phase 2 is active. The canonical rejection ABI, explicit call-region retention,
and arbitrary-arity exact call substitution are complete. The current unit has
537 functions: 75 clean, 462 legal but unsupported, and zero rejected. Its
self-parse is deterministic at 1,368,342 source bytes, 271,668 tokens, and
135,307 unique-head AST nodes. The parser census is 3,472 regionful calls: 123
explicit and 3,349 staged omissions. LLVM support remains the same
byte-identical 15-function module.

Kernel v0.8 and its tag-only enum equality implementation are complete.
Stage 0 and the wfc reader recognize only exact nominal tag-only `eeq`/`ene`;
`ieq`/`ine` remain integer-only. Stage 0 lowers both enum operations directly
at the selected tag width, including i1 for `Bool` and two-variant enums. The
complete compiler-source migration has 255 `eeq` sites in 92 functions across
18 files and 22 tag-only types, with zero non-integer `ieq`/`ine` sites. The
approved 16-case additive conformance surface passes, and hostile tests cover
same-width nominal confusion, payload enums, malformed symbol/type topology,
declaration collisions, missing explicit type arguments, all bounded truth
tables, and direct raw/optimized code shape. Five source functions move to
CLEAN through the repaired equality domain: `semantic_body_kind_is`,
`llvm_scalar_node_is`, `llvm_scalar_type_is`, `llvm_scalar_mode_is`, and
`llvm_scalar_operation_is`.

The F1 acyclic read-only tranche now covers general signatures and exact effect
rows, general tag-only enum matches and values, shared struct fields, typed
scalar and tag-only-enum buffer `index`, and field/buffer `len`. The next
body-semantics capability is F2 loops (`loop @label` plus `break`) and local
mutation. `lexer_scan_string` remains the source-order frontier, held jointly
for F2 and F5 aggregate return. F3 writers, F4 bounded statement-scoped
reborrow, F5 aggregate construction/return, and F6 `allocates`/`move` follow in
that order. Whole-unit LLVM lowering, including production emission of general
`eeq`/`ene` calls after revalidating their domain, remains the separate Phase-2
step-2 track and may not treat CLEAN classification as emission authority.

## Work outside the seven-phase scope

- `table`, pool, arena, other sealed components, checked-source libraries,
  catalog cards, and public I/O or FFI wait for a later owner-directed roadmap.
- Concurrency waits for a later roadmap. Its memory model, synchronization
  effect, sharing rules, target lowering, per-form models, and acceptance rows
  must land before any thread, queue, scheduler, or reclamation component.
  Retain the fixed-fan-out v1 choice. Reconsider the dynamic loop-spawn capture
  carve-out after the concurrency layer exists or when a named scenario needs
  runtime-count workers with shared outer borrows; require its own hostile
  review. Fold AMD-7 and AMD-8 into the ratified rules at that landing. Place
  MM-1 through MM-6 and MM-10 in the kernel specification, and keep the writer
  manual limited to MM-0 and MM-7.
- Fold AMD-6 into the ratified rules when a production phase first consumes
  branded endpoints. That obligation does not wait for concurrency if an
  earlier branded component needs it.
- A wfc migration to `seq` remains a measured experiment after phase 7. The
  current structure-of-arrays compiler stays as its control.
- The two completed shipped-library protocols stay frozen. Do not tune them or
  add a third target to rescue or enlarge their claims.
- Surface ergonomics and deferred proof-accounting promotion work require their
  recorded triggers and a later plan amendment.

## Process gates

- Run `make check` and `make -C compiler check` before and after each completed
  slice. Do not weaken a check to restore green.
- Give each completed step one commit and one appended decision-log line.
- Keep semantics, lowering, conformance, and measurement artifacts tied to the
  same frozen source hashes. Treat an unexplained difference as a defect.
- Require hostile review before shipping any new fact channel or production
  safety judgment. A green automated gate does not substitute for that review.
- Keep all repository artifacts in English. Keep `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`
  byte-identical.
- Update the relevant MCTS node and its `.alt/` in the same change as any design
  redecision. Preserve rejected designs with paired reasons.
- Stop a phase on a red gate, an unresolved semantic flag, an unsound model, a
  failed mutation, or a missed performance band. Repair or reject the design
  before expanding scope.

## Evidence pointers

- Compiler state and architecture: `compiler/README.md`, `compiler/sources.txt`,
  `compiler/test_self_parse.py`, `compiler/test_semantic_unit.py`, and
  `compiler/test_llvm_supported.py`.
- Toolchain decision: `mcts_mem/whitefoot/toolchain.md` and
  its rejected alternatives under `mcts_mem/whitefoot/toolchain.alt/`.
- Proof contracts and reviews:
  `optimizer-language-research/implementation/requires-check-accounting-REVIEW.md`
  and `mcts_mem/whitefoot/fact-channels.md`.
- Capability landing evidence:
  `optimizer-language-research/implementation/systems-performance-coverage/DESIGN-DOSSIER.md`,
  `m1-loan-judgment/RULES-RATIFIED.md`, `m1-loan-judgment/programs.json`,
  `m2-spec-mass/KERNEL-DELTAS-DRAFT.md`, `m2-spec-mass/optables.md`, and
  `m3a-kernel-dryrun/RESULTS.md` under that directory.
- Completed shipped-library evidence: `experiments/default-floor/RESULTS.md`.

Evidence supports a gate. It does not advance the execution cursor.
