# Derivation Ledger — kernel spec (living artifact)

The original full audit covered `kernel-spec-v0.3.md` and `docs/constitution.md`
on 2026-07-07. Versioned amendments below carry that audit through the active
`kernel-spec-v0.17.md`. Requirement (owner + META-6): every rule is provably
derived, directly or indirectly, from the constitution — or flagged. Statuses:
**derived** (existence and form), **derived_existence_only** (the rule must
exist; this form is minimality-selected and awaits its experiment),
**underived** (no chain; may not ratify).

**Current statistics: 53 derived · 41 existence-only · 0 underived**
(94 rules in v0.17)

## Re-grounding priority queue (weakest chains)

- FORM-4 (no comments; doc fields) — existence rests on spec regularity alone; the doc-field replacement is audit-flagged R1-unaccounted human residue with no carded grounding and no recorded R5 exception; the registered doc-vs-inline-comment scaffolding experiment (audit obligation e) never ran. Nearest entry in the whole ledger to underived.
- GRAM-7 (statement-only match) — recorded selection ground is the literal R3 disqualifier ('cheapest to specify' / 'preserve one arm shape'), while the critique record's own W1 signal ('the most common pattern an AI writer needs') favors the rejected value-arm candidate; time-urgent because FORM-1 + EX-1 bake the helper idiom into normative bytes.
- TYPE-6 (no-shadowing) — verbatim 'cheapest for a canonical-form language' provenance; uniquely, no gate entry flagged it or scheduled validation before the 2026-07-05 audit; no card weighs fresh-name burden against stale-binding confusion for W1 writers; an R2-reversal watch site.
- OP-2 negation half — the div/rem half is a semantic theorem (no modular semantics for divisor zero), but the ineg.wrap exclusion is unjustified by the rule's own rationale: two's-complement wrapping negation is sound modular arithmetic (Rust ships wrapping_neg; LLVM 'sub 0, x' wraps). Minimality-selected inside an otherwise theorem-backed rule; N003 also sits outside both adversarial verification rounds. [ADDRESSED v0.3 — see ledger entry]
- META-4 (stated-once) — status derived, but the thinnest of the four regularity invariants: its recorded selection ground is D2 spec-compactness, i.e. W2-only post-D2a; carried by the D2a retention clause plus CI-machine-checkability; the ledger even records an apparent META-4 self-violation (FORM-1 and META-1 both state the one-spelling fact with no cross-reference). [ADDRESSED v0.3 — see ledger entry]
- OWN-9 (noalias consequences) — status derived but effectively single-card-class: the P0 payoff is in-kind only; no noalias on/off benchmark exists anywhere in the corpus and the Rust noalias enable/disable/miscompile history is still uncarded backlog, so the magnitude of the rule's entire P0 framing is unmeasured.
- FN-6 (polymorphic-recursion criterion) — the syntactic same-type-parameters criterion is strictly stronger than termination requires (rejects finite permutation cycles), yet it is absent from the R3-provisional register entirely — the thinnest audit coverage of any provisional-class form; rejection rate on AI-written recursive-generic code unmeasured. [ADDRESSED v0.3 — see ledger entry]
- FN-7 no-globals clause — rides an uncarded P0/F001 plausibility argument (ambient global aliasing would erode the noalias fact base); no card, debate round, or gate entry decides no-global-state specifically, and reversing it later is a breaking META-5 delta under FORM-1. [ADDRESSED v0.3 — see ledger entry]
- FORM-6 (unit token) — the disjoint-production discharge is analytic, but the underlying token choice has zero provenance of any kind (no card, experiment, debate, or gate entry) and deviates from FORM-3's TYPEID casing convention; a register gap with FORM-1 time-urgency in miniature. [ADDRESSED v0.3 — see ledger entry]

## Ledger

| Rule | Feature | Status | Derivation chain | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| META-6 | derivation-ledger requirement; orphaned chains auto-flag | ✅ derived | Owner mandate 2026-07-07 ('for each feature we must prove it is derived from the constitution') + R1 (a rule with no chain serves nothing) + W3 (arbitrary rules are unauditable) -> META-6; self-applied here. | The native `whitefoot-spec` gate checks that every active rule ID has a row in this ledger; this row is the rule auditing itself. |
| ERR-3 | `propagate` Result forwarding with auto-derived context | ✅ derived | R4 (shift-left recoverable errors; manual re-match invites silent context loss) + W1 (one mechanical pattern) + W3 (propagation cannot drop the error) -> v0.3.1 rule text records the chain; checked-program context records per DIAG-2. v0.13 aligns the operand with OWN-13's already-derived consuming-context model: a direct bare affine own-rooted Result place is consumed exactly once, while explicit `move` remains valid. | Same-E-only in v0 (TYPE-4 no conversions); error-type mapping deferred with delta. The v0.13 amendment changes only how the operand's existing affine consumption is written, not the Ok/Err control flow, cleanup, borrow restrictions, effects, or runtime behavior. |
| ERR-4 | per-operation Result-vs-trap classification | ✅ derived | R4 ladder + META-2 (classification fixed by table, never call-site context) + round-3 overflow classification precedent. | Table-data form; no call-site override exists to misuse (W3). |
| SCOPE-1 | Writer-facing kernel; gated family unreachable by writers | ✅ derived | W3 (no writer-emittable unsafe or trust) -> round-3 unsafe-hatch synthesis 2026-07-02 (no free-form writer-emittable unsafe anywhere; exactly one gated fact-boundary construct family with obligation ledger) + D0a (gated channel is toolchain-side, AI-authored human-approved) -> kernel programs contain no gated constructs. T1/T2 premises require writer-unreachability of unsafe. R0 delta named in constitution: Rust's unsafe is writer-accessible everywhere. Stub visibility/pricing per round-4 kernel-priced-first law (GATE/LEDGER stubs counted in v0.1 delta). | Strongest W3 rule in the section. Gate-efficacy experiments (D0a's declared revisit trigger) are unscheduled per the audit, but they affect the human-approval process for gated content, not the writer-unreachability this rule states. |
| SCOPE-2 | Acceptance: canonical parse, all rules, proven-else-checked, no third state | ✅ derived | T1/T2 via R4 shift-left + W1 (runtime failure is the worst AI feedback channel) + W3 (no papering over) -> round-3 decided law: proven-else-checked for D1-critical checkable facts in ALL build modes; writer proof burden = round-2 floors exactly; nothing writer-stated trusted unchecked; formal spine amendment: no WRITER-EMITTABLE third state, toolchain-gated ledger entries the sole trusted-assertion class. P0/R0: no debug/release semantic divergence is a named Rust delta; checks elidable only by proof preserves P0 without opening a W3 hole. Fact enumeration (bounds; alias-disjointness where a check form exists) follows round-3's conservative no-emit fallback and overflow-non-D1-critical classification. | Section-5 formal-calculus reconciliation (Featherweight Rust selected 2026-07-06) is still pending; it affects checker soundness at scale, not this acceptance frame. Runtime-check cost vs P0 is bounded by proof-elision in principle but not yet benchmarked. |
| SCOPE-3 | No-UB envelope conditional on TCB and foreign-code behavior | ✅ derived | T2 verbatim: no-UB conditional on declared TCB (round-3 Layer 4), itself derived from T1's premises plus R4 (silent corruption is the forbidden failure mode). D1a owner ruling confirmed the Rust-class conditional envelope, gated on checker-core feasibility — that blocking gate PASSED 2026-07-02 (prototype, 19/19 tests after v0.1). Clause (b) FFI conditionality per round-3 mandatory conservative FFI declaration frames + D4 rewrite-first FFI-narrow scoping. Conditional (not unconditional) form was an explicit owner arbitration, recorded 2026-07-02. | The rule is derived; DISCHARGING the theorem it states still awaits ratification preconditions (section-5 FR reconciliation, section-9 effect carding). SCOPE-3 was made conditional as a v0.1 blocking fix — the unconditional v0 form was the unsound one. |
| SCOPE-4 | Contract violations trap with machine-readable report; abort, no unwinding | ✅ derived | R4 ladder (runtime trap ranks above forbidden silent corruption) + W3 ('failures trap with reports, never silently' — constitutional text) -> round-2 decided law: no exceptions/unwinding, Result + trap=abort (error-handling verdict: replace_with_alternative). Machine-readable report per R4 rule-citing diagnostics + R1/W1 feedback loop (T1 derivation: an unattended writer cannot debug latent runtime failure). No-unwind consistent with D4's unwind-abort-at-boundary FFI ruling. | The report-content half is under-delivered: DIAG-3 report field schemas remain DEFERRED, which the audit flags as R4-load-bearing rather than deferrable; the free-text trap message is a flagged R1 human-residue channel. Neither undermines this rule's own chain. |
| FORM-1 | One spelling, one byte form; reject non-canonical; never auto-format | 🟡 existence-only | Existence derived: R3 (one way to say anything) + W3 (canonical bytes leave nowhere to hide edits) + round-2 syntax verdict — drift detection, node-path diagnostics, content-addressed caching on the carded D001/D004 compile-time channel, F003/N006 frontend-soundness-chokepoint argument against any second surface. Conservative-extension clause from round-4 decided law. Form NOT derived: reject-never-canonicalize vs accept-and-canonicalize was never tested; specific byte form untested — R3-provisional register item (constitution audit 2026-07-05). | Unrun: drift-hypothesis test, caching-realization measurement, reject-vs-canonicalize A/B with repair-round-trip counts. Audit R1 tension: every byte-level deviation costs a full generate-reject-regenerate loop. Time-urgent: FORM-1 itself makes any later evidence-driven form switch a breaking canonical-form change. |
| FORM-2 | Exhaustive byte-level formatting: indent, spacing, line discipline | 🟡 existence-only | Existence derived: FORM-1's one-byte-form regime plus W3 canonical bytes require a TOTAL byte-format definition (an unspecified formatting dimension would reopen multiple spellings); round-2 syntax obligations mandate exactly one legal byte-level formatting. Form NOT derived: the specific conventions (two-space indent, blank-line separation, inter-token spacing table, one statement per line) were never tested for model formatting-error rates — R3-provisional register item. | Audit additionally flags indentation/spacing as R1 human-residue: they encode information already carried by braces/separators; the training-distribution-alignment defense exists but is uncarded. R1 justification pass owed (card the grounding or record an explicit R5 exception). W2 (token-count) arguments for or against are non-gating post-D2a. |
| FORM-3 | Lexical classes: IDENT, TYPEID, REGIONID, LABEL, OPNAME | 🟡 existence-only | Existence derived: GRAM-1 deterministic single-parse grammar + META-2 context-freedom require disjoint, casing/sigil-partitioned token classes (token kind decidable without context). OPNAME's mode-suffix shape (iadd.wrap as one token) is the evidence-backed part: round-2 floor 'one numeric mode per arithmetic node' + N001/N002 (N001 CONFIRMED 2026-07-06, N002 partially verified). Specific sigil choices (apostrophe REGIONID borrowed from Rust, @LABEL, casing split) NOT derived: convention-borrowed without the divergence census LEX-1 itself mandates. | Register gap: FORM-3 is not in the R3-provisional register, but its surface-shape choices are the same untested class as the registered GRAM-5 place forms. The v0.2 gate entry records the full-lexicon Rust-divergence audit as backlog — that audit is the completing step for the borrowed REGIONID spelling. Census entry opened for the apostrophe REGIONID: Rust-lifetime prior PARTIALLY matches (names a borrow region) but diverges on inference expectation (Rust lifetimes are inferred/elided; ours are always explicit lexical blocks) — mitigation: spec states explicitness; rename question held for the full D3 lexicon audit. |
| FORM-4 | No comments; documentation only in doc fields | 🟡 existence-only | Existence derived: the FORM-1/W3 canonical-byte regime must legislate comments — free comment bytes are unbounded alternate spellings of the same semantic construct and a hash-invisible edit channel. The no-comments FORM rests on spec regularity alone (audit finding): R5 removes only the human-readability argument for comments; it does not positively select their removal for AI writers. R3-provisional register item; R2 watch. | Registered experiment (audit obligation e): doc-only vs inline comment scaffolding as models' local reasoning anchors, across W1 tiers — never run. The doc-field replacement itself is audit-flagged R1-unaccounted human residue (prose in a language humans are declared not to read); it needs a carded grounding (writer re-read context, R5 ledger-audit support) or an explicit recorded R5 exception. Nearest item in the ledger to underived. |
| FORM-5 | Exhaustive literals: decimal-only suffixed numerics; no boolean literals | 🟡 existence-only | Existence derived: FORM-1/R3 require an exhaustive single-spelling literal grammar; mandatory type suffix aligns with the round-2 floor (zero implicit value-changing conversions) and the D2-corrected explicit-facts ruling; one-canonical-escape-per-character is one-spelling applied to strings. Form NOT derived: decimal-only (no hex/binary for bitmask code) never evaluated against AI codegen needs, and no-boolean-literals belongs to the never-debated match-only-conditional complex (GRAM-6/PRE-1/FORM-5) — both R3-provisional register items. | Registered experiments: decimal-only vs hex/binary literals (audit obligation f); conditional-form A/B including Bool-as-prelude-enum (obligation b). The STRING-only-in-doc/check restriction usefully CONTAINS the audit-flagged human-residue free-text channel but was not itself evidence-selected. |
| FORM-6 | unit token resolved by disjoint grammar productions | ✅ derived | Given the choice of a single shared token, GRAM-1 determinism + META-2 (no context-dependent spellings) FORCE exactly this rule: the disjoint-production statement is the analytic discharge of an apparent META-2 violation. The underlying token choice is NOT derived: lowercase 'unit' in type position deviates from the FORM-3 TYPEID convention, and a two-spelling alternative (TYPEID 'Unit' + value 'unit') was never evaluated; no card, experiment, debate, or gate entry exists. | Register gap — flag for R3-register extension. Low stakes, but FORM-1 makes a later respelling a breaking canonical-form change, so the same time-urgency argument the audit applies to GRAM-7 applies here in miniature. FIXED v0.3: provenance recorded — lowercase follows the TYPE-1 primitive convention; one-spelling per R3. |
| LEX-1 | Naming policy: invariant names, no backend vocabulary; uniq ruling | 🟡 existence-only | No-backend-IR-vocabulary half fully derived from R6 (artifacts must not marry one backend; 'noalias' names a lowering consequence, not a source invariant — F001 is the fact, not the name). Invariant-naming + divergence-census half instantiates W1 (borrowed names with divergent semantics mislead weak writers carrying training priors — an effect round-2 syntax records as admissible but unquantified) and R4 (diagnostics cite names that state checked invariants). The uniq-not-mut ruling is owner ruling D3 (v0.2 gate, 2026-07-03) resting on an analytic divergence argument, not an A/B. | The R6 half needs no experiment and is the audit's only completed backend-coupling check. Completing the rest: a naming A/B across W1 tiers (uniq vs mut error rates) and the backlogged full-lexicon Rust-divergence audit. Two-axis mode vocabulary DEFERRED with recorded delta per META-5. |
| GRAM-1 | Deterministic unambiguous grammar; 1:1 productions; no desugaring | ✅ derived | W3 (canonical bytes leave nowhere to hide edits) + R4/DIAG-1 (diagnostics cite exactly what the writer wrote; no desugared ghost forms) -> round-4 decided regularity invariants (one spelling per construct, no sugar/inference in the writable surface), retained under W1 grounding by the D2a clause now in the constitution's own W2 text; one-parse determinism is a precondition of FORM-1's single legal byte form and DIAG-2's acceptance-decidable-from-artifact. | Caveat: the claim that regularity invariants survive under W1 grounding is an owner assertion (D2a), not yet experimentally validated — all three round-4 topics (spec-budget, familiarity, compiler-as-teacher) still sit at research_needed. The two-token-lookahead bound is an unexamined implementation detail; harmless because any resolution preserving one-parse serves the chain. |
| GRAM-2 | Item grammar: fn, struct, enum, contract, conform declarations | 🟡 existence-only | Existence: PROG-1 closed world + round-2 decided law require a closed declaration inventory. Generics production: R2 (round-2 generics keep_essential, checker-collapse precedent; Go pre-1.18 natural experiment) + D001 CONFIRMED (monomorphization) -> P0. struct/enum: round-2 error-handling and dispatch decided law (ERR-1, D002). But contract_decl/conform_decl transcribe FN-3, shipped normative while the round-2 interfaces verdict sits at needs_evidence (audit procedural breach); the doc production transcribes FORM-4, an audit-flagged human-residue rule with no recorded R1 grounding. | Mixed rule: the generics/struct/enum/fn productions are fully derived; contract_decl/conform_decl inherit FN-3's blocking interfaces back-fill experiment (Go interface{}-boxing as reference failure mode); doc awaits the R1 justification pass or an explicit R5 exception in user-directives.md. Byte-level choices (semicolons, field order) are FORM-2-class, provisional. |
| GRAM-3 | Type and mode grammar; modes always written, region-explicit | ✅ derived | T1 via explicit modes/regions: D1a checker-simplification lever (explicit regions/borrows over inference, owner-sanctioned) -> checker-core prototype PASSED 2026-07-02 (D1a gate) -> P1 feasibility; P0 via 'region-explicit borrows' as a named R0 delta of record and F001 (ownership/exclusivity = the optimizer's noalias fact base); `&uniq` spelling fixed by LEX-1 owner ruling D3 with divergence-census rationale. | Leaf productions inherit open items ledgered elsewhere: array/slice inventory (see TYPE-2; arrays-loops gate prototype_needed) and const := literals only (see CONST-1). The two-axis mode vocabulary (exclusivity x write-permission) is a recorded LEX-1 DEFERRED delta; the full-lexicon Rust-divergence census is still backlog per the v0.2 gate entry. |
| GRAM-4 | Statement inventory: let, set, loop, break, region, check, match | 🟡 existence-only | Existence and most members derived: region_stmt is the OWN-3 lexical-region D1a lever -> T1; check_stmt is the stated-and-checked channel from the round-3 proven-else-checked decision -> W3/T2; let with mandatory mode/type feeds TYPE-5's boundary-explicit floor. But loop_stmt/break_stmt bare form is the R3-register ANCHOR case (the register's 'GRAM-5/6' citation maps to these v0.2 productions): chosen for grammar minimality, counted/structured/iterator alternatives never evaluated for W1 error rates or provability (backlog r3_loop_form). | Provisional parts: the loop form (register anchor; arrays-loops gate still prototype_needed, and the audit flags an active R1-performance tension — bare loop+break surfaces zero A005 facts the leading candidate supplies by construction); the match arm shape (GRAM-7 register item); and check's free-text STRING message (audit human-residue flag — DIAG-3 already mandates rule ID + node path; needs an R1 grounding or recorded R5 exception). The loop-form evaluation folded into the arrays-loops prototype would complete the loop half. |
| GRAM-5 | Expression/place grammar: explicit move, borrows; prefix deref/index places | 🟡 existence-only | Semantic skeleton derived: explicit `move` makes OWN-1 affine consumption syntactically visible -> T1 + W3 (no hidden ownership transfer) + W1 (weak writer sees consumption); borrow_expr with mandatory REGIONID is the D1a explicit-borrows lever -> T1 -> F001 noalias facts -> P0; index-as-sole-place feeds OP-4 bounds -> T2 via round-3 proven-else-checked. But the deref(p)/index<T>(p,i) PREFIX spellings are on the R3-provisional register: one-spelling minimality choices with no AI-codegen evaluation on record (the audit's thinnest, single-audit item). | What the checker consumes (explicit move/borrow/index nodes) is derived; the surface spellings are untested — the AI-codegen validation harness (audit new obligation, blocks all register items) would complete this. Additional unflagged gap: `construct` is positional (fields in declared order) with no named-field form, never evaluated for W1 field-order transposition errors; not on the register. |
| GRAM-6 | No operators, no if/while/for; match conditionals; loop+break iteration | 🟡 existence-only | Existence of ONE canonical operator/control surface: R3 one-way + FORM-1 + W3 canonical bytes. The specific form is minimality-selected on all three axes (audit, three-auditor consensus): no-if first appears in kernel-spec-v0 with no debate, card, or gate entry behind it, and D002 grounds exhaustive-match dispatch, not scalar boolean conditionals; the prefix-only arithmetic surface has all AI-writer behavioral claims EMPIRICAL-UNTESTED per round2-syntax (1.35-1.48x token proxy unpriced, precedence-misbinding vs transcription-error rates unmeasured, training-distribution penalty unquantified); loop+break froze the weakest-fact iteration form while the round-1 arrays-loops gate (prototype_needed) has a leading candidate supplying A005 consumer facts by construction — an open R1-performance/P0 tension. | Three register items converge on this rule (loop form, no-if/match-only, prefix surface). Blocking registered experiments: syntax A/B with real tokenizers and whole programs, conditional-form A/B (match-on-Bool vs dedicated two-arm branch) across W1 tiers, loop-form evaluation measuring error rates AND trip-count/independence provability. Time-urgent: FORM-1 makes any later evidence-driven switch a breaking canonical-form change. Round-4 familiarity re-scoped to evidence input only, so familiarity cannot rescue or condemn this form without measurement. |
| GRAM-7 | match in two productions (statement + let-init); value-match via give; helper-fn idiom deleted | 🟡 existence-only | Existence: R3 demands exactly one match form (statement XOR expression), so a rule fixing the category must exist. This form: the spec-critique round-1 record posed exactly two candidates and picked statement-only to 'preserve one arm shape' — cheapest-to-specify, the selection ground R3 explicitly disallows — while the same record calls conditional initialization 'the most common pattern an AI writer needs' (audit, verified against the raw critique record). | Weakest form-selection in section 3: the recorded ground is the literal R3 disqualifier and the record's own W1 signal points toward the rejected value-arm candidate. Completion: the registered conditional-form A/B including helper-fn vs value-arm idiom cost. Time-urgent — FORM-1 plus EX-1's normative bytes bake the helper idiom in, making an evidence-driven switch to expression-match a breaking canonical-form change; the audit lists GRAM-7 among the most plausible R2-reversal sites. |
| TYPE-1 | Primitives: fixed-width ints, IEEE floats, unit; Bool excluded | ✅ derived | P0: machine-code performance forces machine-width types; round-2 decided law 'one numeric mode per arithmetic node' presupposes this fixed-width typed inventory (round-1 numeric-semantics debate; N001 CONFIRMED explicit UB/poison optimization contract, N002 nsw->poison corroborated). The R0 delta of record lives in OP-1's per-node modes, not the inventory — parity with Rust's primitive set is acceptable here because the set is hardware-forced, not a design choice. | The Bool-as-prelude-enum parenthetical inherits the provisional conditional-form register item (no boolean literals; GRAM-6/PRE-1/FORM-5). Inventory cuts are undebated: no i128, no pointer-width usize/isize (len returns u64) — no card or gate entry either way; a W1/P0 evaluation of index-width ergonomics would close it. N002's wraps-modulo verbatim quote remains PARTIALLY_VERIFIED pending a sectioned LangRef fetch (card hygiene, not form risk). |
| TYPE-2 | Composites: struct, enum, array, slice, box, arena | 🟡 existence-only | struct/enum: round-2 decided law — Result+trap error handling (ERR-1) and exhaustive match as core dispatch, grounded in D002 CONFIRMED (vtable dispatch costs) -> P0/W3. box/arena: round-2 memory-automation replace_with_alternative decided law ('no GC/pervasive RC; checked ownership + explicit storage contracts') + D1a lexical-region calculus -> T1 -> F001 -> P0. array<T,N>/slice<'r,T>: existence from P0 + T1/T2 (bounds-checkable region-carrying views, OP-4), but these specific minimal forms were fixed while the round-1 arrays-loops gate sits at prototype_needed with a leading candidate carrying shape/trip-count/independence facts by construction (A001/A005/A008/A009-class). | Four of six constructors fully derived; the array/slice halves need the arrays-loops prototype to complete — richer fact-carrying array types (MemRef strides, Futhark size-in-type, Chapel domains) are carded but were never run against the minimal form. Not on the R3 register by name, but the audit's loop-form R1-performance tension is the identical pattern one production over; flagged here honestly rather than laundered under the register's silence. |
| TYPE-3 | All types/modes/effects nameable without compiler execution | ✅ derived | W1: a weak writer must be able to write any needed type from the in-context spec alone — compiler-execution-dependent or unnameable types break that categorically; coherence precondition of the decided boundary-explicitness floor (round-2 explicit-instantiation law + FN-1 signatures + D2-corrected uniform annotation): if every let and call site must state types, every type must be finitely writable; W3/FORM-1: one canonical name per type is the one-spelling rule lifted to the type level. | A coherence requirement, so no experiment is needed for the rule itself. It holds only because FN-5 removes unnameable types (closure types are the standard counterexample); if the provisional FN-5 env-struct replacement is revised after its registered A/B against restricted closures, TYPE-3 must be re-verified against the replacement's type grammar. |
| TYPE-4 | No implicit conversions; explicit cvt returns Result when narrowing | ✅ derived | Round-2 decided law verbatim ('zero implicit value-changing conversions', a floor since 2026-07-02) -> W3 (a silent value change is exactly the corruption/cheat channel the writer must not have) + R4 ladder (narrowing is a check-time Result value, never silent truncation; total widening stays pure) + T2 no-UB envelope (N001 CONFIRMED poison contract; N002 nsw->poison corroborated by the verified-UB manual). R0 delta nameable: Rust's `as` silently truncates; cvt makes narrowing a checked Result. | The strongest-derived rule in section 4: existence and specific form (total-vs-Result split) both trace to decided law plus the R4 ladder. Residual debt is card hygiene only: N002 remains PARTIALLY_VERIFIED, and the audit lists N001/N002 verification as a section-4/7 ratification precondition — N001 was discharged 2026-07-06; N002's verbatim quote is pending. |
| TYPE-5 | No cross-statement inference; full annotations everywhere; explicit instantiation | 🟡 existence-only | Boundary half (signatures, call-site type/region/const arguments): decided floor — round-2 monomorphization-with-explicit-instantiation law + D2-corrected owner ruling (program verbosity free; explicit facts beat generation tokens) -> P0 via the 'more optimizer-visible facts than rustc emits' R0 delta of record. Interior half (every let fully annotated): the round-2 type-inference verdict still sits at needs_evidence, yet the mandate shipped normative — audit procedural breach; the deciding redundancy-independence experiment (correlated-annotation-noise vs checked-redundancy error correction, O(k^2) token/cascade costs) never ran. | On the R3 register; the redundancy-independence experiment is a BLOCKING ratification precondition (audit adoption item 2). Post-D2a the spec-budget objection to inference is moot, but that removes an opposing argument rather than supplying W1 selection evidence — the derivation still needs the experiment. The merged audits split on blocking vs non-blocking-confirmatory priority; an owner ruling is owed. The boundary half would remain derived even if the interior half is reversed. |
| TYPE-6 | Declaration-before-use; no shadowing; disjoint namespaces | 🟡 existence-only | Existence: GRAM-1 determinism + W3 demand a name-binding rule (ambiguous or context-dependent resolution would break canonical one-parse and checker soundness), and declaration-before-use suits the no-inference D1a checker direction. The no-shadowing/no-redeclaration form: recorded origin is verbatim 'cheapest for a canonical-form language' (spec-critique-round1-raw.json) — the literal R3 disqualifier; not among the D1a checker-simplification levers; no card or experiment weighs fresh-name burden against stale-binding confusion for W1 writers. | Weakest provenance on the register: uniquely, no gate entry flagged it or scheduled validation before the 2026-07-05 audit. Registered completion paths (audit obligation c): A/B shadowing-on/off across W1 model tiers, or re-ground no-shadowing as a D1a checker lever with evidence recorded in notes/checker-feasibility-findings.jsonl. Also an R2-reversal watch site alongside GRAM-7 and no-if. The namespace-disjointness, declaration-before-use, and label-scoping clauses are the derived residue. |
| CONST-1 | closed non-arithmetic const-expr sublanguage; const N usable/forwardable (D8 closed) | ✅ derived | Existence: round-2 decided law — 'no in-language metaprogramming (closed constant-expression sublanguage only)' — demands a constant-expression rule, and array<T,N> (TYPE-2/GRAM-3) forces at least integer literals. THIS form (literals only, sublanguage DEFERRED with recorded delta): an admitted stopgap the audit lists as a live constitutional tension — the metaprogramming ban is law while its replacement is deferred, inviting exactly R2's own cited natural-experiment failure mode (Go pre-1.18 go:generate: unchecked external templating filling a language gap). | Ratification precondition per the audit's extended list: deliver the closed constant-expression sublanguage (+1 section META-5 delta) or produce evidence that weak writers need no generation-time abstraction beyond monomorphized generics; the audit additionally mandates a monitor for external-templating emergence in any writer corpus. The R2 exposure grows the longer v0 persists, so this is a time-sensitive debt, not passive backlog. |
| OWN-1 | Single ownership; copy/affine classes; explicit and contextual consumption; whole-binding death | 🟡 existence-only | T1 (both derivations: P1 via R4/W1/W3, and P0 via F001 noalias fact base) -> round-2 memory-automation decided law (checked ownership replaces GC/RC; evidence asymmetry F001/F006/C004 vs F007/J004) -> affine+move form per D1a owner-sanctioned levers (K001 Austral use-once linearity, K003 Featherweight Rust copy/move semantics) and spec-critique v0.1 blocking fix (copy/affine classification + explicit `move` spelling). Explicit move serves W3/R4 in ordinary expression contexts; the closed OWN-13 match and v0.13 ERR-3 propagation contexts state their consumption structurally and therefore consume a direct bare affine own-rooted place without hiding whether consumption occurs. | Core (single owner, affine consumption, copy/affine split) is fully derived and prototype-tested (D1a gate 19/19). Outside the two closed contextual-consuming forms, bare affine use still rejects at check time. Demoted for the strictness knobs: whole-binding death on partial moves and no-reinitialization are completeness cuts STRICTER than the reconciliation target (K003: FR handles partial moves), with sound-program rejection rate unmeasured — same debt class as register items OWN-3/8/11. Completing steps: FR mapping (section-5 ratification precondition) plus rejection-rate/repair-loop measurement on the R3 validation harness. |
| OWN-2 | Three borrow modes (own, shared, uniq), always written | ✅ derived | T1 via F001 exclusivity — shared-XOR-unique is the verified Rust/FR natural experiment (F001, C004, K003) -> OWN-9 noalias facts -> P0. Region-explicit borrows are a named R0 delta of record in the constitution. Always-written modes = D1a lever 'explicit regions/borrows over inference' (checker-feasibility findings, owner ruling 2026-07-02) + D2 corrected ruling (program verbosity acceptable; explicit facts beat generation tokens). `uniq` naming = owner ruling D3/LEX-1 with divergence-census rationale (exclusivity is the invariant, mutation only its permission). | Interior application (modes on every let) shares TYPE-5's R3-provisional debt — the round-2 type-inference verdict sits at needs_evidence and the redundancy-independence experiment is unrun; the boundary half is a decided floor. Two-axis mode vocabulary (frozen/shared-write) DEFERRED with recorded delta under LEX-1. Any spec-uniformity argument here is W2-flavored and weak post-D2a; the load-bearing grounds (D1a checker feasibility + F001) are independent and stand. |
| OWN-3 | Lexical regions with outlives-or-equals; incomparable caller regions fail closed | 🟡 existence-only | Existence: T1 requires a region model to bound borrow liveness; region-explicit borrows are a named P0/R0 delta over Rust. Form: lexical-only regions and unique names are D1a owner-sanctioned checker levers ('lexical borrows before NLL-class flow sensitivity'; K001 Austral scope-delineated borrows, K002 Polonius declarative-rules evidence); fail-closed incomparability is the W3/OWN-8 posture (never guess an ordering). | Explicit R3-provisional register item ('checker completeness levers OWN-3/8/11 — rejection-rate unmeasured'). Selection ground is the D1a implementation-effort ceiling (owner-sanctioned), not evidence the completeness cut is cheap for AI writers; sound-program rejection rate and restructuring churn unmeasured. K004 Oxide is the recorded NLL upgrade path if lexical proves too lossy; FR (K003) reconciliation is the ratification precondition. |
| OWN-4 | Borrows live to region end; flow only outlives-ward | ✅ derived | T1: dangling references unrepresentable -> given OWN-3's lexical regions, a borrow may be stored/passed/returned only into regions it outlives — the unique sound rule for that skeleton. Form adversarially validated: the v0 direction was INVERTED (unsound), found independently by two critics (spec-critique round 1, v0.1 blocking fix) and now prototype-tested (D1a gate, 19/19). | Inherits OWN-3's provisional lexical-liveness lever (named-region liveness, not last-use). The inversion history is precisely why FR (K003) reconciliation remains the completing step: the checker-prototype report records that rule-text soundness at scale, not code volume, is the residual risk. |
| OWN-5 | Resolved-place exclusivity; no moves through borrows; finite direct-slice origins | ✅ derived | T1 via OWN-5 exclusivity (the constitution's T1 clause cites F001 by name) -> OWN-9 noalias facts -> P0/R0. Independently P1: W3 — the writer cannot fabricate aliased mutation; R4 — violations reject at check time, never surface at runtime. Form: shared-XOR-uniq with reads-under-shared is the verified natural-experiment semantics (F001; C004 data-race half); restatement over resolved places and the move-through-borrow ban are spec-critique blocking fixes closing demonstrated holes. v0.17 extends only direct slice values: the closed producer set yields finite static origin sets that overapproximate one runtime root, and every access is checked against every member. | The best-derived rule in the section — it is T1's own anchor. Borrow holders remain singleton-rooted under the FR reconciliation; direct slices use the separate finite-origin proof in the v0.17 amendment and reconciliation note. The P0 payoff remains in-kind, not in-magnitude (no noalias on/off benchmark exists; Rust noalias enable/disable/miscompile history still sits in the missing-research backlog). |
| OWN-6 | Borrow holders; place resolution; statement-scoped temporaries | ✅ derived | T1: without holder resolution, places rooted at holder bindings alias &uniq content invisibly — a demonstrated v0 soundness hole (checker-prototype v0.1 report: holder-rooted aliasing; resolve() added as a blocking fix). Form implemented and machine-tested (19/19); OWN-5/OWN-7 judgments are defined over resolved places, making the exclusivity theorem actually enforceable. | Counterexample-driven provenance. The call-scoped temporary clause (un-let borrows live to end of enclosing statement) is an untested detail choice; FR reconciliation (K003 covers reborrowing) should confirm the resolution rewrite generalizes. |
| OWN-7 | Conservative overlap: prefix, literal-index disjointness, pairwise slice origins | 🟡 existence-only | Existence: T1 — OWN-5 is vacuous without an overlap judgment. Form: the prefix rule gives exact struct-field disjointness; index disjointness only when both indices are unequal literals is conservatism selected under the D1a soundness-over-completeness lever. v0.17 replaces the former blanket slice-overlap approximation with the forced set lifting: two fully substituted slices overlap when any pair of possible resolved-place origins overlaps; immutable const needs no write-conflict claim. | Rejection cost on AI-written array and multi-origin slice code remains unmeasured. Formal origins never prove actual arguments disjoint, and no runtime branch narrows the static set. This still interacts with the arrays-loops gate and A005-style dependence facts; a future runtime-disjointness check would require its own approved fact path. |
| OWN-8 | Reject-when-unsure; diagnostics cite rule and restructuring | 🟡 existence-only | Existence forced: W3 + T1 — accepting unproven programs either trusts the writer (W3-forbidden) or voids the theorem, so the checker must fail closed; owner ruling D1a adopts the lever near-verbatim ('checker may reject sound-but-hard patterns and demand restructuring'). The diagnostic clause chains to R4 (rule-citing check-time rejection) and DIAG-1. R0 note: the posture is Rust-like, but no writer-accessible unsafe escape (W3) is the named delta. | Explicit R3-provisional register item. The posture's EXISTENCE is fully forced; what is untested is its W1 price — sound-program rejection rate and repair-loop convergence (R2 exposure: a checker cut that inflates rejections harms AI codegen, the audit's D1a-R2 tension). Rejection-rate measurement accompanies the section-5 formal-calculus reconciliation as a ratification precondition. |
| OWN-9 | Non-normative optimizer noalias consequences of borrows | ✅ derived | P0 directly: F001 (exclusivity -> unaliased access paths) + F002 (non-interference around writes is the payoff class) + F003/F004 (LLVM noalias encodings consume such facts) — this rule is the R0 delta of record ('more optimizer-visible facts than rustc emits') rendered as spec text. R1 satisfied via P0 service; non-normative, so it costs no acceptance semantics; LEX-1 keeps backend vocabulary (noalias) out of the writer surface. | Payoff is in-kind, not in-magnitude: no noalias on/off benchmark exists anywhere in the corpus (round-1 aliasing evidence gap; Rust noalias incident history still in the missing-research backlog). If magnitude measures small, this rule's P0 framing weakens, but the underlying rules' T1 grounding is unaffected. |
| OWN-10 | Borrowed storage must outlive the borrow's region | ✅ derived | T1 with a concrete counterexample: the v0 spec+prototype ACCEPTED returning a borrow of an own parameter into a caller-supplied region — a dangling reference (checker-prototype v0.1 report; the former positive test became the negative test). Rule added as a v0.1 blocking fix; three-case form (own-rooted / borrow-rooted / arena-rooted) is the closure of that hole across all place roots; implemented and tested (19/19). | Strongest provenance short of formal proof: counterexample-driven, then machine-checked. The arena-rooted case depends on STOR-4's region-carrying types (whose family evidence is thinner — see STOR-4); FR reconciliation remains the ratification gate for the general formulation. |
| OWN-11 | Loops: no outer-region borrows or outer moves inside | 🟡 existence-only | Existence: T1 across back-edges — a flow-insensitive checker must prevent per-iteration re-moves (use-after-move) and borrows that outlive an iteration. Form: the bluntest sound cut (ban outer-region borrows and outer moves entirely), adopted as a D1a effort lever via the v0.1 blocking fix; audit register item OWN-3/8/11. | Rejection rate on realistic loop code unmeasured and NOT covered by the checker prototype (v0.1 remaining-scope gap). Interacts with the R3-provisional loop form (GRAM-5/6, the audit's anchor case) and the open arrays-loops gate (A005 trip-count/reduction facts): the registered loop-form experiment should evaluate OWN-11's restructuring cost jointly. FR back-edge treatment is part of the reconciliation. |
| OWN-12 | Call boundary: region substitution, borrow arguments, effect-row check | 🟡 existence-only | Existence: T1 interprocedurally — without a call rule, two overlapping &uniq arguments and callee writes behind caller borrows are representable unsoundness (spec-critique round-1 blocking finding; the OWN-CALL cluster fix converged across critics). Form: signature-carried facts (FN-1 discipline) judged under OWN-5 at instantiated regions — the critique's own fix text, near-verbatim. | Existence is forced; this exact instantiation discipline was never machine-checked — OWN-12 is in the checker prototype's remaining-scope gaps, and the effect-row clause leans on Section 9, itself gated on effect-exemplar carding before ratification. FR (K003) call-boundary mapping plus prototype extension would complete the chain. |
| OWN-13 | Match moves owned scrutinee; binder modes derived from scrutinee | 🟡 existence-only | Existence: T1 — match/ownership interaction was wholly unspecified in v0 (flagged by all four critics; binding payload by value through a shared borrow would move out of borrowed content). Form: the critique record poses two candidates — written binder modes (per OWN-2's no-default stance, critic C) vs uniformly derived modes (critic D) — and the spec chose derived-not-written on one-uniform-rule/stated-once grounds, the minimality basis R3 disqualifies as a selection ground. | Creates the kernel's only unwritten mode, in tension with the OWN-2/TYPE-5 always-written regime; whether weak writers correctly predict binder modes is a W1 question with no experiment run. Not prototype-covered (v0.1 remaining-scope gap). Post-D2a the stated-once ground is W2-flavored and weak. Completing steps: match-binder written-vs-derived A/B on the R3 harness, plus FR-style model checking of the match rules. |
| STOR-1 | Storage class by type: box heap, arena region, else frame | ✅ derived | Existence: round-2 memory-automation decided law — explicit, checked storage contracts replace GC/pervasive RC (evidence asymmetry: F001/F006/C004 checked-ownership facts vs F007/J004 conditional, never-guaranteed escape analysis) -> T1 + P0 (guaranteed frame residency is the R0 delta vs managed runtimes). Form: v0's stack-default-with-unless clause was unanimously blocking in the spec critique (META-2/META-3; round-4 zero-context-dependence, retained under W1 per D2a); storage-as-function-of-type follows from region-carrying arena types (the STOR-4 soundness fix) plus META-4 non-redundancy. foreign_shared reservation + demotion-as-floor-violation is round-3 decided law verbatim (foreign-retainable memory pre-declared at allocation site; compiler-inferred demotion REJECTED), rescoped by D4. | Type-carried vs per-binding storage annotation was never W1-tested (the checked-redundancy question shared with TYPE-5's unrun experiment), but the annotation would duplicate information the type already spells, so the candidate axis is thin. Vs Rust the storage classes themselves are parity; the R0 delta lives in the contract vocabulary and STOR-3's artifact-surfaced deallocation, not here. |
| STOR-2 | box_new/arena_new creation calls; deref content access | ✅ derived | P0: the `own box<T>` return is verified card F004 made a typed invariant — LLVM's noalias return models a fresh allocation-like result, the strongest allocation contract. T1: arena_new's region-carrying return type is the STOR-4 soundness fix (escape locally decidable per META-2). Allocation-as-ordinary-table-call feeds EFF-2's syntactic allocates rows -> W3 (effect rows checkable both ways, no hidden allocation). | Surface spellings inherit R3-provisional register debts ledgered elsewhere (OP-1 prefix-call surface; GRAM-5 deref place form). allocates(heap/arena) row semantics lean on Section 9, gated on effect-exemplar carding. F004's payoff magnitude is unmeasured, as with all noalias facts. |
| STOR-3 | Compiler-derived drops, artifact-surfaced on every region-exit edge | 🟡 existence-only | Round-2 memory-automation verdict, requirement (b) near-verbatim: compiler-derived drop points surfaced as explicit operations plus machine-readable lifetime reports, never invisible runtime effects (F009: even flagship ARC un-hides reclamation as explicit optimizer-visible IR ops) -> T1/R4 (no invisible effects) + W3 (artifact honesty; round-3 cross-cutting invariant 2 and the generalized drop-op template) + P0 (compiler-placed drops admit sink/batch/elide). Region-exit-edge completeness (fallthrough/break/return) is the spec-critique STOR-6 blocking fix. No finalizers / no RC: round-2 decided law (C003 possibly-shared pricing; hidden-effectful-drop conflict; RC re-admissible only with new cards). | Two form slivers block full derivation: (1) purely compiler-derived vs double-entry writer-written free statements is the round-2 REMANDED question — 'empirically undecidable today' — and the named decisive spelling experiment (drift rates, compile-iterations-to-green, injected lifetime-intent bug detection) never ran; (2) reverse-declaration order is an untested convention (W3/DIAG-2 force determinism, i.e. AN order, not this one). Everything else is decided law. Drop elaboration is also absent from the checker prototype (not_yet_covered). |
| STOR-4 | Arena values confined within their region's block | 🟡 existence-only | Existence: T1 forced by counterexample — v0's arena escape was proven unsound by two blocking critics (alloc_arena returned bare `own T` carrying no trace of 'r; moving past region end was well-typed use-after-free, and the claimed OWN-4 enforcement could not fire). Form: the critique's own fix — region-carrying arena<'r,T> makes confinement locally decidable (META-2), with content borrows routed through OWN-10. | Untested on two axes: arena content borrows/slices sit in the checker prototype's remaining-scope gaps, and the region/arena mechanism family still has ZERO exemplar cards — Cyclone/MLKit (incl. leak pathologies)/Koka/DPJ remain in the missing-research backlog, a condition the round-2 verdict itself set ('mandating it today would violate the standing rule'). K003 Featherweight Rust has no arena construct, so FR reconciliation does not discharge this rule; it needs its own family carding plus the round-2 requirement-(d) region-quality/timeliness lints. |
| STOR-5 | Storage is borrow-free and region-free in the enumerated content carriers | ✅ derived | T1 — the v0.7 statement-scoped child-reborrow non-escape guarantee requires that a borrow cannot be stashed in storage. v0.17 closes the analogous returned-slice hole: a region-bearing leaf hidden in a struct field, enum payload, array/buffer element, or box/arena content would require per-leaf provenance and cleanup state that the direct FN-1 signature cannot express. W3 forbids approximating that hidden state, and R4/OWN-8 select explicit rejection until the separate stored-value design exists. The recursive post-substitution check closes generic and `box_new`/`arena_new` laundering through one ordinary type judgment. | Borrow storage remains grammatically absent. Region-bearing content is now a real source rejection: function and nominal generic arguments are owned by FN-2, while enumerated stored-content positions are owned by STOR-5. A direct nested-slice type is not itself one of those positions and remains language-valid but compiler-unsupported; ordinary `slice_of` cannot inhabit it through an array or buffer because that source element position is prohibited. No runtime representation or check changes. |
| STOR-6 | Selected-target layout and exact target-domain allocation/address arithmetic | ✅ derived | T2 requires every materialized value and address calculation to remain defined on the selected target; R4 requires failure before allocation or address formation; R6 forbids replacing the target constraint with a backend-specific source-language size cap. DIAG-2 and the facts-off invariant require one checked obligation that target lowering either proves or guards. | A static target-layout failure and a dynamic target-domain TCB/resource failure are non-language outcomes: neither rejects the source under DIAG-1 nor produces a DIAG-3 language trap. The rule adds no hidden allocation, effect, or alternate lowering path. |
| OP-1 | All computation as mode-named prefix calls from operation table | 🟡 existence-only | P0/R0 delta of record 'per-node numeric modes' + round-2 decided law (one numeric mode per arithmetic node; zero implicit conversions; nothing overloaded) + N001 (definedness lattice is an optimization contract; CONFIRMED 2026-07-06) + N002 (wrap-vs-nsw contract split; PARTIALLY_VERIFIED) + round-1 numeric-semantics leading candidate (truthful-lowering explicit-mode architecture, the only position robust to the soundness ruling) -> a mode-explicit, non-overloaded operation inventory must exist. The prefix-call-only writer surface is R3-provisional: constitution-audit register lists OP-1/GRAM-6 explicitly; per round2-syntax all AI-writer behavioral claims are EMPIRICAL-UNTESTED. The v0.8 `eeq`/`ene` addition is evidence-selected rather than inferred from existing compiler code: the investigation-baseline compiler census found 253 non-integer equality sites across 93 functions, 18 files, and 22 tag-only types; the intervening v0.7 slice leaves 251 sites across 92 functions and the same 18 files/22 types, and the live census must be rerun immediately before landing. The accepted v0.7 structural fallback requires 6,952 variant-pair arms across the 21 non-`Bool` types, with 11 `Bool` sites using existing Boolean operations, while the smaller 21-mapper/262-arm/484-call form needs an external injectivity guard because v0.7 does not reject duplicate mapper result codes. Same-variant identity over one exact nominal tag-only enum is a finite, pure, total operation, so the operation-table row closes that W3 gap without adding conversion, ordering, payload observation, or a safety-relevant fact channel. | The mode architecture is the best-derived half of the kernel; the surface form is not. Completing experiments: the pre-registered syntax A/B (real tokenizers, whole programs, operand-order vs precedence-misbinding error rates, repair iterations) across W1 model tiers. Residual card debts: checked-mode lowering is uncarded (round-1: only wrap and nsw lowerings are card-backed), and N002's wraps-modulo verbatim quote is still pending a sectioned LangRef fetch. The `eeq`/`ene` spelling has no independent weak-writer A/B; its selection is constrained by the already-derived OP-7 domain-prefix rule and by the rejection of overloaded `ieq`/`ine`. Payload equality and structural equality remain unselected. |
| OP-2 | No wrap modes for division, remainder, negation overflow | ✅ derived | Div/rem half: T2 — no modular-arithmetic semantics exists for divisor zero, so a .wrap form would be UB (T2 violation) or an untruthful lowering (W3/F003); N003 (LLVM div-by-zero is immediate UB) prices the hazard; R4 leaves .trap/.checked as the ladder. META-3 (no exception clauses) dictates the table-data form, per the v0.1 delta 'OP carve-outs became table data'. Negation half: does NOT follow from the stated divisor-zero argument. | Adversarial finding: two's-complement wrapping negation IS sound, well-defined modular arithmetic (Rust ships wrapping_neg; LLVM 'sub 0, x' wraps), so the absence of ineg.wrap is minimality-selected, not T2-forced, and OP-2's own rationale is silent on it. Either add ineg.wrap or restate OP-2 to justify the negation exclusion honestly. N003 is workflow-confirmed but absent from both adversarial verification rounds; the div/rem argument is a semantic theorem independent of the card, so that half stands regardless. FIXED v0.3: ineg.wrap added (two's-complement wrapping negation is sound modular arithmetic); rationale scoped to div/rem where it is a genuine semantic theorem. |
| OP-3 | Strict-only IEEE float modes; fast-math open | 🟡 existence-only | Existence of per-node named FP modes: round-2 one-mode-per-node decided law + P0/R0 delta of record (no debug/release semantic divergence, per-node modes). Strict-only content: T2/W3 conservative floor — round-1 numeric-semantics found the FP corpus a near-total void ('three advocates converging on strict-default from priors must not be laundered into corroboration'), so R3 forbids adopting any evidence-free relaxation; strict is the one FP choice that cannot be semantically wrong, only slow. Marking approximation modes OPEN rather than deciding them is itself R3-compliant. | Strict is admissible-by-elimination, not evidence-selected: 'strict IEEE' vs 'LLVM default unflagged FP' is an uncarded distinction (constrained intrinsics/strictfp have zero corpus coverage), so even .strict's implementability-as-specified is unpriced. Completing work: the commissioned FP evidence phase from round-1 follow-ups (per-flag fast-math semantics, flag dropping across inlining, contraction, rounding/exceptions, reproducibility) plus a fast-math performance-delta measurement before any relaxation plank. |
| OP-4 | Unproven index bounds checked in all builds; proof-only elision | ✅ derived | T1 (bounds violations ARE memory unsafety, no sound fallback) -> round-3 check-policy decided law: proven-else-checked for D1-critical checkable facts in ALL build modes, in the record's own words 'forced by D1 + the verification spine + trap=abort, not chosen' -> W3 verbatim ('checks are elidable only by proof') -> P0/R0 delta (no debug/release semantic divergence) -> R4 ladder (proof > runtime trap > forbidden silent corruption). The solver-promotes-performance-facts-only clause is round-3 proof-burden amendment 2 (solver never gates acceptance, never elides safety checks). Trap observability rides C002 (CONFIRMED 2026-07-06). | The floor is benchmark-robust per the round-3 record: even a catastrophic check-cost measurement cannot reopen ambient assumption, only route pressure into proof/restructure or the gated family. Open debts threaten P0 delivery, not the derivation: the three-way benchmark (asserted vs checked vs proof-gated) is unrun; A005 (now CONFIRMED) has a shape mismatch to per-element checks; the relaxed-trap-ordering/batch-replay-equivalence spec (numeric dossier 2026-07-05) is still owed before checked inner loops vectorize. |
| OP-5 | check-else-trap runtime assertion creating checked facts, never elided | 🟡 existence-only | W3 (contracts cannot be weakened; nothing writer-stated trusted unchecked — the round-3 verification spine) + P0 (a passed check creates optimizer-usable facts on the dominated path; round-3 safety-envelope Layer-0 channel (a) defines stated-and-checked as fact-creating but 'always checked, never trusted', which forces the never-elided form) + R4 (runtime check traps with report, never silent). Channel retention is round-3 proof-burden amendment 1: retained as OPTIONAL, per-fact-class, PENDING the redundancy-independence and proof-ladder experiments. | Channel existence is decided law; its v0 form (single boolean check with free-text message) and the DEFERRED fuller vocabulary (loop invariants, ranges) await the proof-ladder/redundancy-independence experiments, and the constitution audit's R4 reprioritization orders that vocabulary promoted to next-priced META-5 deltas. Sub-component flag: the free-text STRING message is audited R1 human-residue (DIAG-3 already mandates rule ID + node path); it needs an R1 carding as an AI repair-loop signal or an explicit R5 exception. |
| FN-1 | Signatures fully state modes, types, effects, regions, and direct-slice result ceilings | ✅ derived | W1 locality (callers check against signatures alone, no cross-function inference) + P0/R0 deltas of record ('exact effect rows', 'region-explicit borrows' are the named deltas over Rust) -> D2 corrected ruling 2026-07-02 + D1a checker lever -> signature-completeness boundary. v0.17 applies that settled boundary to direct `own slice` results: exact same-region own-slice parameters and immutable const form the finite written ceiling, callers substitute actual sets, and bodies may not return an origin outside it. This is the smallest caller-complete rule that preserves every possible alias/effect source without body summaries or recursive fixed points. | Contract `fn_sig` members derive the same ceiling; only bound `fn_decl` bodies receive return validation. Borrow-mode direct-slice results are rejected because they need the separate returned-descriptor provenance relation. The effect-row component still inherits the section-9 vocabulary gate; signature completeness itself remains settled. |
| FN-2 | Monomorphization-only, explicit, concrete-rechecked, region-free generic arguments | ✅ derived | R2 precedent (round-2 generics checker-collapse; Go pre-1.18 natural experiment) demands generics exist; round-2 verdict keep_essential conditioned on D001 -> monomorphized code performs as concrete code -> P0/R0; explicit arguments follow TYPE-5 and every instance is rechecked under W3/T1. v0.17 adds the conservative region-free boundary: a region-bearing function or nominal type argument can hide slice or arena leaves whose per-leaf provenance and cleanup are absent, so W3 forbids treating the compiler's missing state as acceptance and R4/OWN-8 select a rule-citing rejection. | This is an explicit v0.16-valid-but-unsupported to v0.17 source-rejection change, not an implementation failure recast as invalid source. Direct written slice and arena parameters/results remain available where their owning rules admit them. General per-leaf generic metadata is a deferred amendment. The earlier drift and check-loop-latency debts remain. |
| FN-3 | Complete static source contracts and conformances; no callable behavior | 🟡 existence-only | R2 preserves the need for an eventual bounded-abstraction mechanism and a law home, but the specific behavior surface remains unselected. Independently, W3 requires every admitted source conformance to be a complete checked trust unit rather than an inferred or partial assertion. v0.16 deliberately closes only that static whole-conformance judgment, with one coherent concrete `(type, contract)` key, complete declared-order bindings, and exact callable-signature equality. W1 regularity and W3 trust-unit fidelity select equality of normalized read, write, allocation, and trap capabilities after positional region alpha-renaming: irrelevant occurrence order and repetition do not create a conformance-only signature identity, while no effect capability may be omitted or added. | This static closure does not ratify contract/conform as a behavior-abstraction surface. Source-contract generic bounds and member calls are absent, and all contract metadata is compile-time-only. The interfaces back-fill experiment remains the condition for adding callable behavior; coherence and declared-order rejection costs remain unmeasured. |
| FN-4 | Mandatory checked-law admission; base evidence has no optimizer authority | ✅ derived | W3 requires every writer-stated law to be discharged rather than trusted, and R4 requires an unavailable or refuted discharge to fail closed. P0 preserves the measured checked-law opportunity, but does not let source acceptance evidence silently become optimization authority. v0.16 therefore emits a base derivation only after the closed whole-conformance/member/body/table relation succeeds; `pure` is one required premise and never proves totality or an equation by itself. Any optimization fact must cross a separately approved boundary whose verifier independently rederives the exact relation instead of trusting that base record. The non-normative law-test harness follows the same W3 boundary. | The closed LAWNAME and saturating-add table is a deliberately bounded admission calculus, not a complete algebra system. More laws or operations require a specification addition. No optional law-fact family is active, so accepted laws currently change neither checks nor facts-off lowering. |
| FN-5 | No function values, dynamic dispatch, or contract-member calls | 🟡 existence-only | Ban half derived: P0 via D002 (verified — dyn-Trait dispatch adds lookup cost and prevents inlining) + D007 (verified — devirtualization/indirect-inlining value) -> round-2 decided law 'no implicit dynamic dispatch (exhaustive match is the core dispatch)'; closures verdict replace_with_alternative. v0.16 states the present boundary honestly: a contract member is not a callee, source-contract bounds are rejected, and validated conformance metadata cannot select an ordinary call. | The replacement half remains unselected. Env-struct behavior parameterization, an explicit member-call spelling, bound substitution, and the direct-call proof are deferred until the registered env-struct-versus-restricted-closure experiment and a real program justify them. v0.16 neither supplies nor claims the old documented env-struct mechanism. |
| FN-6 | Recursion allowed; polymorphic recursion rejected syntactically | 🟡 existence-only | Round-2 decided law monomorphization-only (D001, P0) forces rejecting polymorphic recursion — an unbounded instantiation set makes compile non-terminating — and R4 places the rejection at check time. Existence is therefore mechanically derived. The specific criterion (every call in a cycle instantiates at exactly the caller's own type parameters) is a conservative decidable form, strictly stronger than termination requires (it rejects finite permutation cycles). | Same class as the OWN-8 reject-when-unsure levers but NOT in the R3-provisional register — thinnest audit coverage of the FN section; flagged here. Sound-program rejection rate for AI-written mutually recursive generic code is unmeasured; a W1-tier codegen experiment on recursive-generic patterns would complete the derivation or force a relaxation. v0.3: deliberate over-strength now RECORDED in the rule (OWN-8 reject-and-restructure posture); rejection-rate experiment registered. Form still awaits measurement. |
| FN-7 | Single main entry, capped effects, no globals/'static | 🟡 existence-only | PROG-1 closed world (round-2 decided law) demands a unique entry point — existence derived. The 'at most allocates(heap), traps' cap follows mechanically from EFF-1 + OWN-3: no caller-supplied regions exist at entry, so reads/writes rows are unspellable. No-global-state/no-'static rides on the OWN-3 lexical-regions D1a lever plus a P0/F001 argument (ambient global aliasing would erode the noalias fact base) that is plausible but nowhere carded. | No card, debate round, or gate entry decides no-global-state specifically, and OWN-3 is itself R3-provisional (rejection-rate unmeasured). Adding statics/'static later is a breaking META-5 delta under FORM-1. Completing evidence: W1 experiment on program shapes that idiomatically want globals (config, interning tables) plus the section-5 formal-calculus reconciliation. v0.3: derivation basis recorded in the rule (P0 noalias erosion, W3 hidden channels, T1 future shared state); GlobalsAA-class carding remains backlog. |
| FN-8 | Concrete checked `requires` prologue; downstream proof only | 🟡 existence-only | Existence and semantics are evidence-selected: the base64 ceiling showed 1.7x removable-check headroom, PROOF-1 recovered 1.17x while leaving exactly 12 output-capacity writes, and the remaining relation is a single entry fact, so P0/R0 justify a boundary fact channel. W3 plus OP-4/OP-5 force stated-and-checked rather than trusted `assume`: the predicate executes and traps in every build, while only a deterministic proof may remove dominated implicit checks. W3/T1 and the observed direct-C entry path require universal boundary coverage rather than reliance on known Whitefoot callers; R4 places an unproved violation on the runtime-trap rung instead of silent corruption. EFF-2 exactness forces `traps` to remain syntactically exhibited after proof elision. The pure/total operation-table-only ANF sublanguage is the D1a/OWN-8 conservative closure: it gives the checker one local, non-mutating proof graph and rejects anything whose totality or dependency stability is uncertain. | The concrete-only boundary, always-retained check, and no-caller-obligation semantics are selected. The particular `requires { let_stmt* check_stmt }` spelling is minimality-selected (reuses existing ANF/check nodes), therefore R3-provisional pending a W1 code-generation/repair comparison against other single-spelling surfaces. Contract/refinement use is deliberately deferred rather than silently assigning conditional semantics to FN-3/FN-4. |
| EFF-1 | Canonical effect-row grammar: reads/writes/allocates/traps over regions | 🟡 existence-only | Existence: P0/R0 — the constitution names 'exact effect rows' as a delta of record over rustc; round-2 minimal-core decided law puts an effect row on every signature (grounded F001/F002/F003 non-interference payoffs); round-3 proof-burden includes the effect row in the mandatory writer floor. Canonical order and 'pure' as the unique empty-row spelling: R3/FORM-1 one-spelling + W3 canonical bytes. The specific four-effect, region-granular vocabulary: never evidence-selected. | Section 9 is spec-gated on region/effect exemplar carding before ratification — the spec's own admission the form is untested. The effects dossier's candidate vocabulary (free, throw, async, blocking, IO, synchronization, cancellation, unknown-foreign) was explicitly compared 'without selecting a winner', and region granularity inherits OWN-3 lexical regions, itself an R3-provisional D1a checker lever. Exemplar carding is the completing experiment. |
| EFF-2 | Syntactic exhibits relation; rows checked both directions; set-wide origin projection | ✅ derived | Undeclared-but-exhibited errors follow W3; declared-but-unexhibited errors follow the exact-effect P0/R0 delta; syntactic stability follows R4/W1 and DIAG-2. v0.17 lifts existing ultimate-origin projection over every member of a direct slice's finite origin set. At calls, formal declaration identity selects descriptor-mode and slice-data projections before region substitution, so equal actual region spellings cannot merge distinct suppliers or erase an effect. | The set lifting is forced by T1/W3 once FN-1 permits multiple possible origins: projecting only the runtime-chosen or one arbitrary origin would be unsound. The effect vocabulary still inherits the section-9 exemplar-carding gate, and exact-row repair churn remains unmeasured. |
| EFF-3 | pure licenses dedup/reorder; elimination needs termination proof | ✅ derived | P0 via F002-class redundancy payoffs -> pure must license deduplication and reordering, which are sound without a termination assumption precisely because pure excludes traps and all effects (different trap orders would be observable via the report; effect-free reorder is not). Elimination restricted: T2 + W3 proof-only-elision — deleting an unused pure call assumes termination, an unstated unproven fact the round-3 spine forbids assuming; v0 ships no termination checker, so the conservative no-elimination fallback (round-3 conservative-fallback law pattern) is forced. Entered as a blocking spec-critique v0.1 fix ('pure-elimination restricted, no termination assumption'). | Deductive chain; no experiment is load-bearing. Note the elegant escape from round-3's 'purity has no carded check form -> conservative-only' problem: kernel purity is never asserted, only computed syntactically via EFF-2, so it never enters the trusted-assertion ledger. Unpriced residue: the P0 cost of retaining unused pure calls (likely negligible); a termination checker is a pure upgrade path. Inherits the section-9 ratification gate. |
| EFF-4 | Trap aborts: no unwinding, no cleanup, report only | ✅ derived | Round-2 error-handling decided law (trap=abort, universal nounwind): F008 CONFIRMED (EH representation constrains optimization — funclet register-allocation costs), both zero-cost-EH exculpatory claims REFUTED 0-3 and preserved against reintroduction, C002 CONFIRMED 2026-07-06 (halt-with-report precedent, the only carded post-violation observability story), D001 CONFIRMED (branch-based Result lowering needs no unwinder) -> P0. W3 verbatim ('failures trap with reports, never silently') + R4 (runtime trap over forbidden silent corruption; the report is the machine-readable feedback channel). 'Cleanup does not run on abort' is the round-2 verdict's explicit invariant downgrade. | Two still-owed specs are open obligations that do not threaten the derivation: concurrent-trap semantics (tasked since rounds 2-3, answered nowhere) and the batch-replay-equivalence rule for vectorizing checked loops (numeric dossier 2026-07-05) — without the latter, strict trap ordering is a P0 vectorization cliff. The multi-process-harness wall-clock cost (one diagnostic per process death) remains the EMPIRICAL-UNTESTED W1 cost the verdict knowingly accepted; the round-2 follow-up measurement has not run. |
| ERR-1 | Errors are Result/Option values; no exceptions or unwinding | ✅ derived | Round-2 error-handling verdict replace_with_alternative -> decided language law 'no exceptions/unwinding (Result + trap=abort)'. P0: F008 CONFIRMED cost card, refuted (0-3) zero-cost-EH exculpations, unwind edges taxing exactly the F002-class payoffs the aliasing corpus exists to unlock; D001 CONFIRMED — monomorphized Result lowers to concrete branch-based values, matching the F009/SIL visible-semantics lesson. W1/R4: exception safety is an implicit, cross-cutting, compiler-unchecked, rare-path invariant — the worst class for a weak writer — while Result drift is caught at every type-checked call site (shift-left). | The verdict itself rules the untested residue non-flipping: 'no untested claim, resolved either way, would put catchable exceptions or drop-during-unwind back in the core'. Honest gap: the verdict accepted the alternative only WITH named requirements, and those are largely undischarged — ERR-3's verified propagation, auto-derived context, and Result-vs-trap classification are DEFERRED, and the anti-sentinel lints exist nowhere. ERR-1 currently ships without the obligations that made it acceptable; see ERR-3. |
| ERR-2 | Exhaustive match, no wildcard arms, variant-addition edit lists | ✅ derived | W3 verbatim: 'exhaustiveness cannot be silenced' — a wildcard arm is precisely the silencing device, and the 2026-07-05 constitution amendment names no-wildcards among the scattered anti-cheat rules unified under W3. Round-2 decided law: exhaustive match is the core dispatch (D002 CONFIRMED 2026-07-02). R4 + R1: variant addition surfaces as check-time, site-enumerated edit lists instead of runtime surprises, feeding the repair loop with rule-citing diagnostics. | W3 is a P1 floor, so the unmeasured W1 cost (edit churn on variant addition across a large generated codebase, flagged in the round-2 AI-writer analysis) can price the toolchain contract but cannot flip the rule; the edit-list generator is that contract's unbuilt half. Statement-only match (GRAM-7) is R3-provisional, but that concerns arm SHAPE, not exhaustiveness — ERR-2 survives any GRAM-7 experimental outcome. |
| PROG-1 | One closed compilation unit; no ABI, loading, reflection | ✅ derived | Round-2 modules verdict replace_with_alternative -> decided language law 'closed-world whole-program compilation'; P0 via D007 (verified — LTO/IPA cross-module visibility enables devirtualization and indirect inlining) and D002 (verified — dispatch opacity blocks inlining); no dynamic loading/reflection additionally closes a W3 injection channel and keeps the T1/T2 envelope decidable over the whole program (SCOPE-2/3). | Audit-recorded R1 tension: whole-program recompile latency at target scale (including FN-2 instantiation re-checking) is unmeasured; the check-loop latency budget is a registered blocking obligation. It could force a caching/incrementality strategy, but not a semantics change — the rule's derivation stands. |
| DIAG-1 | Rejections cite one rule ID, node path, mechanical fix | ✅ derived | R4's own text names this rung: 'check-time rejection with rule-citing diagnostics'; W1 repair loop grounding via round-4 decided law (spec-primary pedagogy with repair loop as reinforcement); determinism/byte-stability from W3 reproducibility (nowhere to hide, stable feedback for the writer). Feasibility exercised by the D1a checker-core prototype gate (PASSED 2026-07-02; negatives asserting exact rule IDs per DIAG-1). | The 'mechanical fix or restructuring' clause's efficacy for W1 repair-loop convergence is unmeasured — round-4 compiler-as-teacher is still research_needed and the AI-codegen validation harness (first-parse success, repair iterations) is the completing instrument. Core form is nonetheless directly constitutional. |
| DIAG-2 | Private checked-program lowering authority with explicit operations and checks | ✅ derived | W3 requires semantic authority to be unambiguous, T1 requires derived cleanup and retained checks to survive into execution, and SCOPE-2 permits check removal only after proof. v0.17 retains one private in-memory checked program as the sole lowering input; it records explicit operations, checks, target-domain obligations, dispositions, every direct slice's finite origin set, and each direct own-slice result ceiling and call substitution. It also retains source-ordered static contract evidence without granting that metadata dispatch, lowering, check-elision, reassociation, or serialized replay authority. | Finite origins are compile-time semantic metadata over the unchanged slice descriptor, not a runtime tag or ABI field. The private representation may evolve; acceptance remains determined by the source checker. A future law-fact family must independently rederive its proposition under FN-4. |
| DIAG-3 | One exact runtime trap record | ✅ derived | W3 requires failures to report rather than disappear; R4 requires a rule-citing runtime trap; SCOPE-4 fixes abort without unwinding. The exact v0.17 record contains the rule ID, fixed message, function name, and source node path in a fixed JSON field order, the minimum deterministic information needed to locate and classify a failing checked site. | v0.17 retains the reduced trap record selected in v0.11 unchanged. Returned-slice provenance adds no runtime report, trap, or required check. Target-domain TCB/resource failure remains outside this record. |
| CAP-1 | Reserve Shareable/Sendable capability predicates; no thread construct | 🟡 existence-only | T1 (standing theorem: data races unrepresentable) via C004 (verified 2026-07-02 with amended scope — Send/Sync-class predicates plus exclusive borrowing yield data-race freedom in safe code, letting the optimizer treat non-atomic memory as unshared -> P0); round-4 decided law prices capabilities inside the kernel FIRST, demanding the stub exist and be counted now. The rule's scope line (data races prevented, general races out of scope) transcribes C004's amended scope exactly. | Round-1 concurrency-model gate is research_needed: the Send/Sync-class route is the evidenced leading candidate, not a promoted design. Binding semantics (auto-derived vs declared, negative impls), and an LEX-1 divergence census for the Shareable/Sendable renames, all await the concurrency layer. Existence + scope are solid; the two-predicate form is unratified. |
| GATE-1 | Contract/signature/law/storage edits are one gated, audited operation | ✅ derived | W3 literal text ('contracts cannot be weakened to make a failing body pass') made unrepresentable rather than detected, per R4 -> round-3 decided law (no free-form writer-emittable unsafe anywhere; exactly one gated construct family; foreign-shared pre-declared at allocation site grounds the storage-contract clause) -> D0a owner ruling (gated content AI-authored, human-approved) with R5 auditability of the trusted base as the recorded deliberate exception. | D0a's own revisit condition (gate-efficacy experiments) has no owning gate entry yet — a registered audit obligation. The single-operation/single-audit-trail packaging follows round-3's 'exactly one' discipline rather than a tested alternative, but W3 fully determines the rule's substance, so this stays derived. |
| LEDGER-1 | One boundary-construct family with per-fact obligation ledger | ✅ derived | W3 (no writer-emittable unsafe or trust) + R4 (manifest-free members unrepresentable, not audited after the fact) -> round-3 synthesis decided law verbatim (exactly one gated fact-boundary construct family sharing a per-fact soundness-obligation ledger; formal spine amendment: toolchain-gated ledger entries are the sole trusted-assertion class) + D0a (AI-authored, human-approved); T2's conditionality on a declared TCB (SCOPE-3) requires exactly this explicit boundary. | The family/ledger form is the decided part. Member-level detail is still open: round-3 ffi-attenuation remains research_needed, and D4 (2026-07-06, rewrite-first FFI-narrow) rescoped FFI members to C-ABI out-calls, foreign_shared buffers, unwind-abort, single-threaded-entry. Per D4's gate entry the wall composite is unaffected, so the rule's derivation stands. |
| PRE-1 | Prelude fixed: Bool, Option, Result, three error enums | 🟡 existence-only | Result/Option half derived: round-2 error-handling verdict replace_with_alternative -> decided law 'no exceptions/unwinding (Result + trap=abort)' under R4; error enums (Overflow, DivideByZero, NarrowError) follow the OP-1 table whose grounding cards are N001 (verified) and N002 (partially verified). Bool-as-prelude-enum exists only to serve the no-if/match-only conditional, which the audit found has no debate, card, or gate entry behind it — R3-provisional register (GRAM-6/PRE-1). Normative-counted status from the v0.1 blocking fix + round-4 no-shadow-spec rule. | The conditional-form A/B (match-on-Bool True()/False() arms vs a dedicated two-arm branch) is a registered blocking experiment; if it flips, Bool's prelude role and FORM-5's no-boolean-literals rule change together — breaking under FORM-1, hence audit-marked time-urgent. The counted-prelude framing was W2-motivated; post-D2a its retained ground is W3/one-spelling, which holds. |
| EX-1 | Byte-exact normative worked example program | 🟡 existence-only | Existence derived: W1 via round-4 decided law (spec-primary pedagogy; teaching pack is a generated, tested build artifact) + W3 canonical bytes (FORM-1/2 need a normative byte-exact exemplar to pin the single legal formatting). Form not evidence-selected: the example normatively bakes in the GRAM-7 helper-function conditional-initialization idiom, which the spec-critique record picked as cheapest-to-specify — the exact ground R3 disallows; R3-provisional register (statement-only match), flagged by all three audits. | Audit marks this time-urgent: FORM-1 makes any later evidence-driven switch (e.g. GRAM-7 to expression-match with value arms) a breaking canonical-form change, and EX-1 hard-codes the current idiom into normative bytes. Completing experiments: the registered conditional-initialization idiom A/B (helper-fn vs value-arm) across W1 model tiers; EX-1 must be re-cut if GRAM-7 flips. |
| META-1 | One spelling per construct; productions map 1:1 to nodes | ✅ derived | R3 near-verbatim ('one way to say anything') + round-2 syntax verdict: every desugaring/elision rule is unverified frontend transformation surface at the F003 soundness chokepoint, N006's Alive2 discipline prices each rewrite at proof grade, so 1:1 production-to-core-node with no desugaring; W3 canonical bytes require the unique spelling. Round-4 regularity invariant, explicitly retained under W1 grounding per D2a (constitutional text). | META-1 demands that ONE survivor spelling exists; WHICH spelling survives is separately provisional for the 13 register items — the audit's price-vs-select rule (spec-delta prices, evidence selects) governs those. Pre-D2a W2 spec-budget motivation is now secondary; the W1/W3 grounding is the recorded one. |
| META-2 | No context-dependent rules; defaulting rules do not exist | ✅ derived | Round-4 decided regularity law ('zero context-dependent rules') retained under W1 grounding per D2a; no-defaulting half independently re-derived from R4 — constitution-audit adopted item 5 records that any defaulting rule (e.g. instantiating round-3 'wrap fallback') would violate R4 + META-2 simultaneously — and from the D2-corrected owner ruling foreclosing elision/inference (uniform verbose-everywhere annotation stands). | No experiment isolates context-dependence harm to weak writers; the chain terminates in constitutional text (D2a retention) plus the recorded R4 analytics, so none is needed — but a W1 measurement would harden the asserted grounding. |
| META-3 | No exception clauses; total rules or table data | ✅ derived | Round-4 decided regularity law ('empty exception lists') retained under W1 grounding per D2a; enacted in the v0.1 revision (exception clauses reduced to 0: STOR-2 default clause deleted, OP carve-outs became table data — META-5 declaration 2026-07-02); 'exceptions ±' is a priced META-5 delta dimension, making the invariant CI-enforceable. | Same asserted-under-W1 caveat as META-2: the weak-writer case for total-rules-over-exceptions is constitutional assertion plus round-4 law, not measurement. W2 spec-budget origin is weak post-D2a; the rule survives on the D2a retention clause. |
| META-4 | Each normative fact stated once; cross-references elsewhere | ✅ derived | Round-4 decided regularity law ('each fact stated once') retained under W1 grounding per D2a (constitutional text); analytically required by the round-4 single machine-checked CI artifact and by META-5 delta accounting — unique definition sites make rule deltas countable and internal contradictions structurally impossible (a duplicated fact that drifts would create context-dependent meaning, violating META-2). | Thinnest of the four regularity invariants: its recorded selection ground is D2 spec-compactness, i.e. W2 — weak post-D2a; the D2a retention and CI-machine-checkability arguments carry it. A weak-model spec-comprehension experiment (stated-once vs checked-redundant spec) would put evidence under the asserted W1 grounding. CI observation: FORM-1 and META-1 both state the one-spelling fact with no cross-reference — an apparent META-4 self-violation worth fixing. Re-grounded post-D2a under W1/W3: duplicate normative statements create reconciliation burden for weak writers and a spec-drift channel (two statements can diverge silently); CI-machine-checkable. No longer W2-only. |
| META-5 | Every spec change declares its delta and selection ground | ✅ derived | Round-4 decided law verbatim ('every design proposal must declare its spec delta') + constitution-audit adopted item 1: every delta also declares its selection ground (evidence-selected vs minimality-selected; spec-delta prices, evidence selects; minimality-selected forms enter the provisional register). This makes META-5 the enforcement mechanism for R3 + D2a reframing. | Current candidates put both declarations in the status header and follow the approval workflow in `WORKFLOW.md`; exact approvals are recorded in `governance/APPROVALS.md`. |
| FORM-7 | numeric-literal range/leading-zero/non-finite reject; inline sign | ✅ derived | T2 (no undefined value) + R4 (check-reject over silent corruption) + W3 (an out-of-range literal is the silent-corruption channel a cheat-proof language forbids) + FORM-1 (integer leading-zero reject). Inline sign discharges iK::MIN (op-table reconciliation). | Range/non-finite reject R4-forced (evidence-selected); float canonical decimal form DEFERRED to the FORM-1 reject-vs-canonicalize gate. |
| TYPE-7 | deref typing; no implicit read-through-borrow | ✅ derived | TYPE-4 (no implicit conversions) + META-2 (no context-dependent meaning) + OWN-1 (copy-on-use for primitives) + OWN-5 (reads through shared borrow permitted). Fills a real typing gap: deref had no typing rule; the auto read-through-borrow alternative violates TYPE-4 + META-2. | evidence-selected. |
| SET-1 | Target-first assignment to a writable copy-typed place, with post-RHS revalidation and one store | ✅ derived | Real loops, buffers and stateful programs require mutation (project P0 experiment path), while T1/T2 forbid an uninitialized ownership hole. OWN-1 + STOR-1/3 make copy-only replacement the complete safe first form: the old copy needs no disposition and the owner remains initialized. R4 + OP-4 require target checks to run before unrelated RHS effects, and OWN-5 requires the commit to be judged against the post-RHS loan state. DIAG-2 carries the checked target and single store so lowering cannot re-evaluate or weaken them. | Affine take/replace remains deferred until failure, overlap and old-value disposition are selected. Target-first rather than RHS-first is correctness-selected because an invalid target must not execute unrelated effects. |
| OP-6 | cvt exact-or-Result partition (29 value-preserving total pairs; no rounding) | ✅ derived | TYPE-4 (no implicit value-changing conversion) + W3 (no silent value change, the named R0 delta over Rust as) + R4 (non-exact to checked Result, never silent) + T2 (float-to-int via fptosi.sat + guards, never raw fptosi UB). 29-pair total set arithmetic-verified. | evidence-selected. |
| OP-7 | op-name convention: `i`/`f`/`b`/`e` domain prefix, mode-suffix axis, nominal/signedness-checked lowering | ✅ derived | W1 (op names predictable from spec alone) + R3/FORM-1 (one spelling per op) + META-2 (context-free op-vs-fn resolution) + P0 (per-node modes, the named R0 delta). Formalizes the existing ilt=slt/ult discipline. v0.8 applies the same truthful-domain rule to enum comparison: `e` names tag-only enum equality, while `i` remains integer-only. `Bool` uses `b` for logic and `e` for equality, selected by the explicit operation name rather than contextual overload resolution. | evidence-adjacent. The new `e` prefix is regularity-selected from the derived naming rule and backed by the enum-equality source/code-shape census, but has not received a separate weak-writer naming trial. |
| OP-8 | edge/table-data semantics + confirmed LLVM lowerings for the added ops; every totality edge closed | ✅ derived | T2 (no added row is poison — each edge total-or-trapped) + W3 (no silent corruption; deterministic fmin=llvm.minimum) + R4 (trap rungs for shift/abs overflow) + P0 (each op is a hardware/IEEE instruction; the R0 parity ground). Lowerings verified on clang 21; imul.sat widen-clamp avoids LLVM #51019; minnum rejected for signed-zero nondeterminism. v0.8 adds a closed totality argument for `eeq`/`ene`: valid same-nominal-type tag discriminants compare with one equality/inequality operation at the selected width; there is no poison edge, payload access, signedness choice, conversion, trap, or invalidator. | evidence-selected (hardware/IEEE-forced). The focused three-variant democ probe observed one raw-IR `icmp eq i32`; clang `-O2` recovered one caller comparison from the mapper fallback but retained its branching helper definition. This is code-shape evidence only, with no timing or byte-count claim. Production lowering still requires the second hostile review in the packet. |
| CONST-2 | const items: immutable program-lifetime rodata; primitive or array<T,N> of const-eligible T | ✅ derived | serves constant tables (masks/trig/CRC) + T1 (cvalue totally defines the value) + reconciled with FN-7 (immutable rodata triggers none of FN-7's three mutable-state hazards) + P0 (frozen rodata is a whole-program read-only fact base; no static mut). Borrow-any-region via the OWN-10 const clause avoids re-admitting a 'static region. | evidence-selected; struct/enum-typed consts deferred. |
| OP-9 | buffer_new size computation traps on u64 overflow before allocating | ✅ derived | T2 (silent under-allocation from n*sizeof(T) overflow corrupts the heap) + R4 (runtime trap over forbidden silent corruption) + SCOPE-4 (contract violation traps). The runtime-size hazard box_new/arena_new lack. | evidence-selected. |
| GIVE-1 | explicit value terminator for let-init match; give-completeness | 🟡 existence-only | R4 (missing delivery is a loud reject, not silent unit) + W3 (delivery cannot be silenced; no tail-expr hiding place) + W1 (one more terminator of the return/break class; no new arm shape) + META-2 (context-dependent legality not meaning, via the break precedent) + D1a (structural last-statement recursion, below the ownership checker). | minimality/regularity-selected -> R3-PROVISIONAL, needs_experiment. |
| GRAM-8 | named-in-declared-order construction; positional removed | 🟡 existence-only | R4 (positional same-typed-field transposition is silent corruption, unrepresentable-as-error; named lifts it to check-reject) + FORM-1/META-1 (one spelling; declared order is one byte sequence) + META-2 (name-iff-two-same-typed rejected) + TYPE-5 (field name a redundant checked fact). D3 census: Swift memberwise, C++20 designated-init, Zig no-positional all PASS. | direction R4-forced; W1 transposition-rate magnitude experiment-gated; needs_experiment. |
| GRAM-9 | flat three-address / A-normal form; call/construct only at expr position | 🟡 existence-only | FORM-1/META-1 (nesting-vs-let-split were two spellings; atoms-in-argument-position makes non-nesting a grammar guarantee) + W1 (collapses the nested-paren/argument-boundary surface; per-line node-path diagnostics) + TYPE-5 (every intermediate carries explicit mode+type). P0 NEUTRAL (mem2reg/SROA make a named local and the subexpression the identical SSA value; not a runtime delta). Precedent: LLVM IR / Rust MIR / ANF. | FORM-1/regularity force it; weak-writer net-sign vs nesting experiment-gated; needs_experiment. |
| GRAM-10 | named match binders (field: freshBinder) in declared order | 🟡 existence-only | R4 (read-side symmetry: positional binders of a two-field variant silently transpose; order+name checking lifts it to reject) + regularity (write-named/read-positional asymmetry is the irregularity the enemy names) + TYPE-6 dodge (fresh binder distinct from the field name, so two arms binding same-named fields never collide). OWN-13 unchanged. | R4+regularity force it; magnitude gated with GRAM-8's experiment; needs_experiment. |
| GRAM-11 | named-in-declared-order arguments for user-fn calls; positional operands for table ops | 🟡 existence-only | R4 (a fn call with two same-typed params has the same silent-transposition hazard GRAM-8 closes for construction; named-in-declared-order lifts it to check-reject) + FORM-1/META-1 (declared order is one byte sequence; names are checked-redundant facts, never a reordering license) + FN-1 (param names from the signature). Table-op calls stay positional (operands order-intrinsic); op-vs-fn is the existing name-lookup partition. | direction R4-forced; W1 magnitude experiment-gated with GRAM-8; needs_experiment. |

## OWN-1 amendment: tag-only enums are copy (2026-07-10)

Derivation: a tag-only enum value (every variant nullary) is resource-free —
no heap, no drop obligation, no interior storage a borrow could alias — so
affine classification buys zero safety (T1 unaffected) while taxing every
boolean expression: an owned `Bool` cannot be loop-carried state (match
consumes it, OWN-13), cannot flow through `band`/`bnot` dataflow (operands
consumed), and forces integer-typed workarounds whose lowering degrades
vectorization (measured: the chunk-summary wc classifier vectorizes at width
2x4 as an i64 recurrence vs width 16 for the i1 form — a 1.6-1.8x kernel
gap; experiments/port-study/wc-chunk-summary). The original affinity of Bool
was minimality-selected (R3 provisional: uniform enum rule), not
evidence-selected; this amendment is the evidence-driven correction (P0 via
vectorizable i1 recurrences; W1 via removing a writer tax with no safety
payoff). Companion FORM-1 discipline: `move` on a copy value is now a hard
error (one spelling per meaning: copies are used bare).

## v0.9 amendment — canonical frontend entrance closure (2026-07-21)

Specification binding:
`spec/kernel-spec-v0.9.md`, SHA-256
`bdfb461d1901f610633c5cbcd2477d24df3c77ca90599b9580c8289e50b82b68`.

The candidate's conditional authority sentence is part of those exact bytes:
the reviewed document becomes authoritative only when installed through the
guarded procedure. No post-approval status-header rewrite is permitted.

Earlier entries remain dated history. For v0.9, this amendment supersedes an
earlier entry only for the changed fact it states; all other status and debt
continue. The original header was a historical v0.3 accounting statement.
Immediately before this amendment the ledger contains 91 unique rule rows: 50 derived, 41
derived-existence-only, and zero underived. This amendment changes 21 existing
rules and adds PROG-2. The v0.9 total is therefore **50 derived · 42
derived-existence-only · 0 underived** across 92 rules.

`derived` means existence and form have a constitutional or evidence-selected
chain. `derived_existence_only` means at least one surviving form choice remains
minimality-selected and R3-provisional. A selected correctness repair does not
erase an independent older form debt.

### Rule amendments

The entries cover all changed rules. This row exposes new PROG-2 to META-6:

| Rule | v0.9 status |
|---|---|
| PROG-2 | derived_existence_only |

#### CONST-1 — derived

- **Delta and selection ground:** the unchanged `const := "[0-9]+" | IDENT`
  production moves from GRAM-3 into CONST-1, its unique semantic owner. This is
  a correctness-selected META-4 repair; it changes no accepted source shape.
- **Continuing chain and debt:** the existing closed-const-language chain from
  R2, R4, TYPE-2, and FN-2 continues. Const arithmetic remains a deferred
  specification addition, and the earlier weak-writer/external-generation debt
  remains open. No v0.8 discrepancy record is claimed closed by this move.

#### CONST-2 — derived

- **Delta and selection ground:** the unchanged `cvalue` production moves from
  GRAM-3 into CONST-2, its unique semantic owner. This is the same
  correctness-selected META-4 repair and changes no value semantics.
- **Continuing chain and debt:** the T1 total-value, immutable-rodata, and P0
  read-only-fact chains continue. Struct- and enum-typed consts remain deferred.
  No v0.8 discrepancy record is claimed closed by this move.

#### DIAG-1 — derived

- **Delta and selection ground:** R4 requires a rule-citing rejection, W1
  requires a stable repair location, and W3 requires deterministic bytes. The
  closed `SourceBytes` / `SourceNode` / `BundleRoot` sum, frontend stage order,
  quote-aware raw spans, source-EBNF failure machine, expected-terminal order,
  and tree-owned FORM-2 gap location are correctness-selected ways to make
  those requirements truthful before and after a tree exists.
- **Evidence and debt:** independent candidate-bound frontend models must agree
  in `grammar-verifier/evidence/frontend-boundary-evidence.json`. Ordering for
  later semantic and target failures remains unselected. This amendment
  addresses `discrepancy:v0.8/diag1-pre-tree-node-path` only after v0.9 is
  installed; the v0.8 record remains immutable history.

#### EX-1 — derived_existence_only

- **Delta and selection ground:** only the enum declaration is re-rendered into
  the executable FORM-2 block shape. Program meaning and the selected match/give
  idiom do not change. This is a formatting-only correctness repair.
- **Continuing chain and debt:** EX-1 still inherits the R3-provisional surface
  debts of the constructs it demonstrates. It is part of the FORM-2 migration,
  not a new semantic claim or an expected-verdict change.

#### FN-1 — derived

- **Delta and selection ground:** the complete-signature chain from W1, P0,
  D1a, and the explicit-fact rulings continues. D24/A-01 additionally selects
  every top-level function signature as visible throughout the completed closed
  unit, so forward calls and mutual recursion do not depend on traversal order.
- **Continuing debt:** this does not make locals, regions, labels, generic
  parameters, or named constants globally visible. It does not resolve contract
  member semantics. A-01 is an owner ruling, not a v0.8 discrepancy ID.

#### FN-4 — derived

- **Delta and selection ground:** W3 requires every writer-stated law to be
  checked rather than trusted; R4 requires an unavailable discharge to fail
  closed; P0 and R0 are supported by the measured checked-law reassociation
  channel. Source acceptance therefore uses one mandatory, compiler-independent
  calculus: exact contract/member/conformance binding, an exact nongeneric
  two-`own D` pure signature, and a bound body containing only the direct
  `return iadd.sat<D>(p0, p1);` shape. The closed integer table defines totality,
  domain equality, the unsigned holds cells, the signed holds/refuted cells,
  and exact zero identity. No optional prover can accept another source shape.
- **Authority boundary:** a successful source discharge emits one canonical
  base derivation record but grants no optimization consequence. A law can
  affect optimization only through a separately approved optional proposition
  family whose independent verifier rederives the exact relation from the
  accepted artifact and binds the artifact, target, backend, proposition, and
  consequence. Absence or failure of that optional path leaves acceptance,
  semantic identity, checks, and empty-overlay lowering unchanged. The gated
  ledger remains a separate source of candidate propositions, not a source
  `conform` discharge. Static-proof menus, general source proof artifacts,
  runtime enumeration, and sampling are not v0.9 admission routes.
- **Evidence and debt:** the exact initial slice is grounded by
  `experiments/checked-law-channel/RESULTS.md` and the protected discharged,
  refuted-signedness, and undischarged FN-4 cases; the fact channel still
  requires hostile review before shipment. Additional operations and complete
  proof calculi are deferred specification additions. Most importantly,
  FN-4's local obligation relation does **not** define whole-conformance member
  completeness, extra/missing binding behavior, law-free conformance behavior,
  generic contract substitution, or behavior-parameterized calls.
  `discrepancy:v0.8/fn3-contract-member-semantics` remains open. This amendment
  addresses `discrepancy:v0.8/fn4-law-admission` only after installation.

#### FN-8 — derived_existence_only

- **Delta and selection ground:** grammar accepts ordinary typed `doc | stmt`
  children, then one early FN-8 pass requires ordinary lets followed by exactly
  one final check before recursively checking children. This correctness-
  selected boundary gives every excluded shape one deterministic owner without
  creating a requires-only parser. FORM-3 owns misuse of fixed `requires` as an
  identifier.
- **Continuing chain and debt:** the measured callee-entry semantics, retained
  check, and downstream proof chain continue. The block spelling remains
  R3-provisional, and contract/refinement use remains deferred. This contributes
  to resolving `discrepancy:v0.8/fn8-reserved-rule-attribution` after install.

#### FORM-2 — derived_existence_only

- **Delta and selection ground:** FORM-1 and W3 require a total byte format.
  The proposal makes it executable by rendering each source's ordered forest of
  top-level item subtrees from the one compilation-unit tree, with closed line,
  indentation, attachment, block, and source-boundary rules. The one-tree and
  per-source ownership mechanics are correctness- and evidence-selected.
- **Evidence and debt:** the primary and independent structural reports and the
  exact protected migration must bind the final candidate. The specific visual
  formatting conventions remain R3-provisional because no writer-tier format
  comparison selected them. This addresses
  `discrepancy:v0.8/form2-protected-conformance-spacing` only together with the
  separately approved protected migration; no verdict change is implied.

#### FORM-3 — derived_existence_only

- **Delta and selection ground:** deterministic grammar terminals and META-2
  require a context-free partition. IDENT now excludes the complete
  mechanically extracted set of exact fixed lowercase grammar words, removing
  fixed-word call/binding derivations without ordered-choice priority. The
  OPNAME explanation is aligned with that exclusion. The exclusion is evidence-
  selected by the two grammar engines and protected FORM-3 attribution.
- **Continuing debt:** casing and sigil choices retain their earlier lexicon and
  writer-tier debt. This contributes to resolving
  `discrepancy:v0.8/gram-terminal-ident-partition` and
  `discrepancy:v0.8/fn8-reserved-rule-attribution` after install.

#### FORM-4 — derived_existence_only

- **Delta and selection ground:** the `doc` production owner reference changes
  from GRAM-3 to its actual unique owner, GRAM-2. This is a minimal correctness
  erratum under META-4 and changes no construct.
- **Continuing debt:** the no-comments and doc-field choices remain
  R3-provisional. This addresses
  `discrepancy:v0.8/form4-doc-cross-reference` after install.

#### FORM-5 — derived_existence_only

- **Delta and selection ground:** one-spelling and no-undefined-value rules
  require a total host-independent finite-float contract. Exact rational input,
  signed zero, IEEE round-to-nearest-ties-to-even, shortest byte length, and
  unsigned-ASCII tie-breaking are correctness- and evidence-selected.
- **Evidence and debt:** exact-rational and independent Rust checks in
  `grammar-verifier/evidence/float-canonicality.json` must bind the final
  candidate. Decimal-only literals, no boolean literals, and other inherited
  surface choices remain R3-provisional. Together with FORM-7 this addresses
  `discrepancy:v0.8/form5-form7-float-canonical-spelling` after install.

#### FORM-7 — derived

- **Delta and selection ground:** T2, R4, W3, and FORM-1 already require finite,
  non-silent, canonical numeric values. Requiring the unique FORM-5 spelling
  closes the former contradiction and is correctness- and evidence-selected.
- **Continuing debt:** no host parser or formatter is language authority. Future
  literal-family additions remain separate specification deltas. This shares
  the FORM-5 discrepancy disposition above.

#### GIVE-1 — derived_existence_only

- **Delta and selection ground:** hostile review found that the prior recursion
  could treat an inner value match, a may-trap operation, or an unproved loop as
  outward delivery. Correctness selects the exact repair: an inner value match
  delivers only to its own let; only a final statement match whose arms deliver
  relative to the same outer value match recurses outward; a may-trap check or
  call retains a continuing edge; no loop is assumed to diverge; and a break
  counts only when its resolved loop lexically encloses that same value match.
- **Continuing debt:** the explicit `give` surface remains R3-provisional. This
  is a semantic contradiction repair found during successor review, not a claim
  to close a separately registered v0.8 discrepancy ID.

#### GRAM-1 — derived

- **Delta and selection ground:** W3, FORM-1, DIAG-1, and META-2 require one
  context-free derivation. The exact maximal raw forms, predicate-valued terminal
  membership, full matching-predicate retention, pairwise-disjoint strong-LL(2)
  `SELECT_2` languages, and one-production/one-node rule are correctness-
  selected and independently executable. Quoted fixed atoms expand inside the
  specification to their unique raw-token sequence: `"&uniq"` counts as `&`
  then `uniq`, while `"->"` and `"=>"` each count as one compound token. This
  leaves exactly one pattern atom: quoted `"[0-9]+"` in `const` denotes one
  complete numeric-form token matching that pattern and is not a fixed atom.
  These self-contained rules make the two-token bound a statement about formed
  tokens and prevent an unreviewed tool-local atom table. Predicate priority
  and parser-local keyword lists remain forbidden.
- **Evidence and debt:** both grammar engines must rerun against the final
  candidate and agree on complete static and bounded generalized-parser
  evidence, including identical fixed-atom expansion and sole-pattern-atom
  classification; the generalized parser remains an evidence tool, never
  production authority. This contributes to resolving
  `discrepancy:v0.8/gram-terminal-ident-partition` and
  `discrepancy:v0.8/gram1-gram7-match-node-bijection` after install.

#### GRAM-2 — derived_existence_only

- **Delta and selection ground:** law arguments and requires entries parse as
  ordinary syntax before their semantic owners check them; `law_arg` and
  `requires_entry` make that boundary explicit. CONST-1 and CONST-2 become the
  unique owners of their unchanged grammar definitions. This factoring is
  correctness-selected where required for strong-LL(2), and otherwise
  minimality-selected to preserve one general parser.
- **Continuing debt:** contract/conform syntax and doc fields inherit their
  existing R3 debts. In particular, broad parsing plus FN-4 does not resolve
  `discrepancy:v0.8/fn3-contract-member-semantics`.

#### GRAM-3 — derived

- **Delta and selection ground:** the type, mode, targs, and targ productions
  keep their source shapes; duplicate `const` and `cvalue` definitions move to
  CONST-1 and CONST-2. Unique semantic ownership is correctness-selected under
  META-4.
- **Continuing debt:** region vocabulary and composite-type debts are unchanged.
  Fixed-terminal partition evidence is owned by GRAM-1/FORM-3, not by an
  invented GRAM-3 priority.

#### GRAM-4 — derived_existence_only

- **Delta and selection ground:** the complete let prefix precedes one explicit
  choice among `ordinary_let_rhs`, `try_let_rhs`, and `value_match`; statement
  and value matches are distinct productions. This factoring is evidence-
  selected by the strong-LL(2) and one-derivation requirements.
- **Continuing debt:** loop and match surface choices remain R3-provisional.
  Broad `requires_entry := doc | stmt` is checked by FN-8 and does not give
  excluded statements requires semantics. This contributes to the GRAM-7 node
  discrepancy disposition.

#### GRAM-7 — derived_existence_only

- **Delta and selection ground:** one-production/one-node requires distinct
  `match_stmt` and `value_match` node kinds in their disjoint source positions.
  This is correctness- and evidence-selected; a shared node kind is not an
  allowed normalization.
- **Continuing debt:** the contained let-initializer match and explicit `give`
  spelling remain R3-provisional. This addresses
  `discrepancy:v0.8/gram1-gram7-match-node-bijection` after install.

#### PRE-1 — derived_existence_only

- **Delta and selection ground:** only the byte layout of the existing prelude
  declarations changes so the normative fence is an exact FORM-2 rendering.
  Types, variants, fields, contracts, and conformer sets do not change.
- **Continuing debt:** Bool-as-prelude-enum and the other earlier prelude form
  debts remain open. This is formatting-only and proposes no semantic or verdict
  change.

#### PROG-1 — derived

- **Delta and selection ground:** the closed-world P0/W3 chain continues while
  PROG-2 becomes the unique unit-formation owner. The rule expressly preserves
  every ban: include, import, module, separate compilation, incremental semantic
  cache, internal ABI, dynamic loading, reflection, and source-path lookup.
- **Continuing debt:** a logical path contributes identity only and cannot
  become a namespace or lookup key. The whole-program check-loop latency debt
  remains. A-10 is an architecture question, not a v0.8 discrepancy ID.

#### PROG-2 — derived_existence_only

- **Delta and selection ground:** GRAM-1, PROG-1, DIAG-1, and A-01 require one
  exact answer for how several transported sources become one program. The rule
  therefore defines an ordered nonempty sequence of exact logical source
  records, portable paths, envelope failures, per-source derivation and FORM-2
  audit, no cross-record syntax, one flattened program root with
  `BundleRootExtent`, whole-unit declaration order, and identity-preserving
  empty records. Existence is architecture- and correctness-required; the
  precise path grammar and nonempty ordered-record form are minimality-selected.
- **Evidence and debt:** independent frontend-boundary evidence must cover
  invalid/duplicate paths, zero records, zero-byte versus one-LF sources,
  reorder/repartition distinctions, root extent, and cross-source isolation.
  Future modules or separate compilation would be new specification decisions.
  This resolves A-10 only after exact approval and installation; A-10 is not a
  v0.8 discrepancy ID.

#### TYPE-6 — derived_existence_only

- **Delta and selection ground:** D24/A-01 selects a total visibility table:
  every top-level function signature is visible throughout the completed closed
  unit, while every other declaration remains visible only after its lexical
  declaration. This removes traversal-order semantics from forward calls and
  mutual recursion without broadening other namespaces.
- **Continuing debt:** no-shadowing remains R3-provisional, and constructor/type
  collision questions remain separate. This does not authorize or define
  general contract-member resolution. A-01 has no v0.8 discrepancy ID.

### Discrepancy and evidence boundary

After, and only after, exact v0.9 installation plus its separately approved
protected migration, these eight immutable v0.8 records have v0.9 dispositions:

- `discrepancy:v0.8/diag1-pre-tree-node-path`;
- `discrepancy:v0.8/fn4-law-admission`;
- `discrepancy:v0.8/fn8-reserved-rule-attribution`;
- `discrepancy:v0.8/form2-protected-conformance-spacing`;
- `discrepancy:v0.8/form4-doc-cross-reference`;
- `discrepancy:v0.8/form5-form7-float-canonical-spelling`;
- `discrepancy:v0.8/gram-terminal-ident-partition`; and
- `discrepancy:v0.8/gram1-gram7-match-node-bijection`.

Their v0.8 records are never rewritten. A versioned v0.9 discrepancy set must
record the installed dispositions. The seven other registered v0.8 gaps remain
unresolved: affine-deref storage lifecycle, retained-check `proof_ref`, EFF-1
row canonicality, body-local region effects, FN-3 contract-member semantics,
`main` return spelling, and dotless-operation reservation. This amendment also
does not settle A-02 through A-09 or A-11 through A-18.

Before installation, all of the following must bind the exact final candidate
hash: the two grammar-engine report, float-canonicality report, primary and
independent FORM-2 reports, frontend-boundary report, protected-surface census,
and exact protected migration. A green development gate is evidence, not owner
approval, and no production parser receives authority from this ledger text.

## v0.10 and v0.11 amendments — resolver and semantic closure (2026-07-22)

`kernel-spec-v0.10.md` changed no rule IDs or derivation statuses. Its
grammar-selected namespaces and deterministic resolver diagnostics close
previously open implementation meaning under the existing TYPE-6, DIAG-1 and
FN-1 chains.

`kernel-spec-v0.11.md` also changed no rule IDs. It closes the first executable
semantic slice, changes the propagation terminal from `try` to `propagate`,
selects one private checked-program lowering authority, and reduces mandatory
runtime reporting to one exact trap record. DIAG-3 therefore moves from
`derived_existence_only` to `derived`; the other changed rules retain their
prior status. The current total is **51 derived · 41 existence-only · 0
underived** across 92 rules.

| v0.11 changed rule | current status |
|---|---|
| FORM-2 | derived_existence_only |
| GRAM-4 | derived_existence_only |
| SCOPE-4 | derived |
| TYPE-6 | derived_existence_only |
| STOR-3 | derived_existence_only |
| OP-1 | derived_existence_only |
| OP-2 | derived |
| OP-4 | derived |
| OP-5 | derived_existence_only |
| FN-1 | derived |
| FN-4 | derived |
| FN-7 | derived_existence_only |
| FN-8 | derived_existence_only |
| EFF-4 | derived |
| ERR-3 | derived |
| DIAG-1 | derived |
| DIAG-2 | derived |
| DIAG-3 | derived |

## v0.12 amendment — copy-place assignment and origin effects (2026-07-22)

`kernel-spec-v0.12.md` adds SET-1 and modifies fifteen existing rules without
changing grammar or terminal inventories. SET-1 is derived above from the real
mutation requirement plus the ownership, storage, ordering, effect, and checked
lowering invariants. EFF-2's ultimate-storage-origin projection closes a
correctness gap: a local region spelling cannot appear in an enclosing function
signature, while a borrow, reborrow, slice, or call must not erase the
caller-visible read or write origin. The other changed rules synchronize these
judgments, their diagnostics, and current governance references. No derivation
status is weakened. The current total is **52 derived · 41 existence-only · 0
underived** across 93 rules.

The active native `whitefoot-spec` gate checks exact v0.17 identity, unique
rule definitions, closed bracketed rule references, and one ledger row for
every active rule. It checks structural coverage; the truth of each derivation
chain remains a review responsibility.

## v0.13 amendment — Result propagation consumption (2026-07-22)

`kernel-spec-v0.13.md` modifies seven existing rules without changing grammar,
terminal inventories, runtime values, effects, or safety checks. ERR-3 now
states that a direct bare affine own-rooted Result place is a consuming
propagation operand, while explicit `move` remains valid. This aligns the sole
Result-forwarding writer form with OWN-13's existing structurally declared
consumption without expanding bare affine use in ordinary expressions.
TYPE-6, STOR-1, FN-4, DIAG-2, and DIAG-3 receive only synchronized current-
version references. No derivation status changes.

## v0.14 amendment — exact integer negation (2026-07-22)

`kernel-spec-v0.14.md` modifies six existing rules without changing grammar,
terminal inventories, operation names, effects, or safety checks. OP-2 closes
the semantics of the existing `ineg` rows: wrapping negation computes modulo
the signed width, trapping negation traps when the mathematical result is not
representable, and checked negation returns `Err(Overflow())` on that same
edge. Thus signed minimum remains minimum only in wrapping mode; all other
representable inputs produce their exact mathematical negation. This follows
the already-derived OP-2 mode partition and OP-8 totality requirements rather
than adding a new semantic mechanism. TYPE-6, STOR-1, FN-4, DIAG-2, and DIAG-3
receive only synchronized current-version references. No derivation status
changes.

## v0.15 amendment — selected-target layout (2026-07-23)

`kernel-spec-v0.15.md` adds STOR-6 and modifies eight existing rules without
changing grammar, terminals, writer-visible values, or language effects.
STOR-6 requires the compiler to select the exact target before target-dependent
output, reject statically unrepresentable complete layouts as a target failure,
and retain explicit target-domain obligations for runtime-sized allocation and
element addressing. Target lowering must discharge each obligation or emit an
exact no-wrap guard on both facts-on and facts-off paths. This closes the
undefined “frame limit” reference without inventing a numeric language cap,
hidden heap fallback, or new source-language rejection. The synchronized
TYPE-6, STOR-1, OP-4, OP-9, FN-4, DIAG-1, DIAG-2, and DIAG-3 text preserves
their derivations. The current total is **53 derived · 41 existence-only · 0
underived** across 94 rules.

## v0.16 amendment — static source-conformance closure (2026-07-23)

`kernel-spec-v0.16.md` modifies nine existing rules without changing grammar,
terminals, source constructs, runtime values, ABI, or language effects. FN-3
now defines one complete static family: a nongeneric source contract owns a
source-ordered unique signature table; a conformance has one exact concrete
subject and one coherent source-contract key; and its declared-order binding
vector is complete, nongeneric, `requires`-free, and signature-exact.
Callable-signature equality uses exact modes and types plus equality of the
normalized read, write, allocation, and trap capabilities after positional
region alpha-renaming. This preserves EFF-1 and EFF-2 as the independently
checked effect authority, ignores only semantically irrelevant repetition and
occurrence order, and admits neither effect subtyping nor an omitted or added
capability.

Every law-bearing validated conformance must then obtain FN-4's closed
discharge. A successful discharge produces one base record used for source
acceptance only. The record grants no dispatch, lowering, check-elision,
reassociation, or optimizer authority; any future optional law fact must
independently rederive the complete relation at a separately approved boundary.
`pure` remains only a required signature premise and does not establish
totality or any algebraic equation.

This closes `discrepancy:v0.8/fn3-contract-member-semantics` for whole static
conformance identity, binding completeness, signature compatibility,
law-free conformance, and mandatory law discharge. It does not add behavior
parameterization: source-contract generic bounds and contract member calls are
rejected or absent, and contracts, conformances, bindings, and law records
have no runtime or lowering representation. The callable behavior question is
an explicit future FN-5 delta rather than part of the closed discrepancy.
TYPE-6, STOR-1, FN-2, FN-3, FN-4, FN-5, DIAG-1, DIAG-2, and DIAG-3 retain
their derivation statuses. The total remains **53 derived · 41 existence-only
· 0 underived** across 94 rules.

## v0.17 amendment — direct returned-slice provenance (2026-07-23)

Specification binding:
`spec/kernel-spec-v0.17.md`, SHA-256
`19642ffb0ad9c7146a84762ada192ed2a25dc446a93c4d060aa29d9a99f69c93`.

v0.17 modifies thirteen existing rules without changing grammar, terminals,
source constructs, runtime values, ABI, operation inventory, effects, traps,
or required runtime safety checks. It closes one caller-visible semantic gap:
a returned direct slice may refer to more than one source even though its
region spelling is the same. T1/T2 and W3 require every possible source to
survive the call boundary so alias, lifetime, and effect checks cannot inspect
the wrong root. FN-1's settled signature-completeness boundary therefore
selects one finite origin ceiling derived from the written signature rather
than from callee bodies.

The finite-origin coverage proof is an induction over the closed producer set:

1. An incoming direct-slice parameter starts with one formal-slice origin.
2. `slice_of` starts with one resolved source place or `immutable-const`.
3. Binding, moving, passing, returning, borrowing the descriptor, and
   resolving through its holder preserve the complete set.
4. A call simultaneously substitutes each finite actual set for each formal
   supplier and takes their finite union plus `immutable-const`.

The induction is closed because every omitted producer receives an explicit
boundary. A slice-valued `value_match` is rejected rather than receiving an
undefined join. Region-bearing generic arguments and enumerated stored-content
positions are rejected under FN-2 and STOR-5 rather than hiding per-leaf
origins. A borrow-mode direct-slice result is rejected because it would require
both returned-descriptor provenance and underlying slice origins. A direct
own-slice body may return only origins in its signature ceiling, excluding raw
borrowed storage and callee-local arena storage. Recursive calls reuse the same
finite written ceiling and need no body-derived fixed point.

Each runtime slice descriptor still points to exactly one storage root. By the
induction above, that root is a member of its static set. OWN-5 and OWN-7 test
every possible origin for alias conflicts, and EFF-2 projects reads and writes
through every origin after formal-occurrence selection and before caller
region substitution. Therefore the static set is a sound conservative
overapproximation: no runtime branch, traversal order, callee body, or
optimizer fact may narrow it for acceptance.

The same signature-formation judgment applies to contract `fn_sig` members.
An own-slice member derives its ceiling from ordinal parameters; FN-3's exact
signature equality after positional region alpha-renaming makes a bound
function's ceiling correspond automatically. The member has no body judgment,
while the bound `fn_decl` remains independently subject to complete FN-1 body
and return-origin validation.

This amendment deliberately changes two hidden-leaf families that were
formerly valid but compiler-unsupported into source rejections:
region-bearing function and nominal generic arguments cite FN-2, and
region-bearing box or arena content—including `box_new<T>` and
`arena_new<'r, T>` substitutions—cites STOR-5. Direct
`slice<'s, slice<'r, T>>` type formation is not an enumerated stored-content
position and retains its language status; the current compiler may report the
unimplemented non-flat value path as unsupported, never as invalid source.
General per-leaf stored provenance, returned-borrow provenance, arena cleanup
transfer, and branch-produced slice joins remain separate amendments.

TYPE-6 and the current-version references in STOR-1, FN-3, FN-4, FN-5, DIAG-2,
and DIAG-3 stay synchronized without changing their underlying derivations.
OWN-5, OWN-7, STOR-5, FN-1, FN-2, and EFF-2 receive the correctness-selected
extensions above. No derivation status changes; the total remains **53 derived
· 41 existence-only · 0 underived** across 94 rules.
