# Whitefoot — agent onboarding

Whitefoot is a systems language for AI-written, human-approved code. Entire bug
classes are unrepresentable (memory corruption, races, silent overflow,
uninitialized reads); there is no unsafe escape. The checker's proofs double
as optimizer facts: safety checks are always on unless a machine-verified proof
discharges them — speed is earned by proof, never by weakening a check.

## Read order

1. `THE-PLAN.md` is the sole source for roadmap and authorization.
2. The tail of
   `optimizer-language-research/implementation/decision-gates.md`.
3. The relevant live `mcts_mem/` node and its `.alt/` history before a
   non-trivial design change.
4. As needed: `CONSTITUTION.md`, `PATTERNS.md`,
   `spec/kernel-spec-v0.8.md`, and
   `optimizer-language-research/notes/user-directives.md`.

## Verify

- `make check` is always required. During Phase 2 it checks repository
  structure, specification governance and integrity, the retained focused
  reference model, conformance data, and the active Rust foundation. Its green
  result is an exact development-capability statement, never a release claim.
- `make -C compiler check` is also required before and after compiler work. The
  root gate incorporates it.
- A release claim uses the separate release gate defined by `THE-PLAN.md`; a
  green development gate is not a completeness claim.

## Standing rules

- English only: every new or modified repository artifact, identifier, comment,
  diagnostic, fixture, test name, document, and file or directory name uses
  English prose. Formal notation, programming-language tokens, numeric data,
  and external proper names are allowed.
- `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` must remain byte-identical.
- The active numbered specification and evidence baseline is
  `spec/kernel-spec-v0.8.md`, SHA-256
  `d04336f7fa8d1a6a0f03fe58a17f972b658217a73a3dff91a906b4ba295328a8`.
  Compiler code does not reinterpret or edit that numbered file.
- Kernel-spec changes are owner-gated in advance. Present the exact delta, get
  explicit approval, create a new numbered version and update every live
  reference, then run `make approve-spec REASON="..."` to regenerate the
  guarded baseline and append the governance entry.
- Earn a specification change with independent evidence, never implementation
  convenience. A compiler/spec discrepancy stops for investigation; compiler
  behavior cannot define the language.
- Conformance source and expected verdicts, frozen oracle digests, and active
  reference-semantics tests are owner-gated. Additive tests are free; modifying,
  deleting, weakening, or regenerating protected material needs exact logged
  approval followed by `make approve-spec REASON="..."`.
- A red spec guard means stop and obtain approval. Never regenerate a baseline
  merely to make the gate green.
- The conformance corpus is implementation-independent authority. Compiler
  capability, internal errors, timeouts, verifier failures, and backend
  failures live in adapter results, not normative expectations.
- Production acceptance has one semantic kernel. The originating invocation
  must project, decode, and completely replay its canonical artifact through
  that same kernel before lowering authority can exist. There is no second
  production semantic verifier; replay checks the artifact boundary and is not
  independent semantic evidence.
- `SourceBundle` order is transport order only. Multi-file composition,
  declaration order, and program-root meaning require an approved successor
  specification.
- Facts that can increase optimizer authority require hostile adversarial
  review before shipment. A green gate is not a review.
- Never trade a source check for speed. Proof-elision is the only path.
- Durability: each completed step gets one commit and one append-only
  `decision-gates.md` entry.
- Keep files cohesive and reviewable. Split by invariant-bearing
  responsibility, not arbitrary line counts, corpus functions, or one-use
  forwarding modules.
- Report results in plain performance and correctness language; keep internal
  project codenames in repository logs.
- Subagent tiering: sonnet only for mechanical work, opus for most tasks, and
  top tier for subtle soundness reasoning. Never haiku.

## Layout

- `spec/` — exact language versions and derivation evidence.
- `conformance/` — compiler-independent source and expected behavior.
- `codegen-corpus/` — implementation-independent proof/code-shape premises
  and hostile near misses; its old democ runner is dormant until replaced.
- `prototype/checker/` — retained focused reference model, never compiler or
  language authority.
- `compiler/` — the active safe-Rust production compiler workspace.
- `tools/` — active repository, governance, and verification tooling.
- `experiments/` — measured evidence and open development workloads.
- `optimizer-language-research/` — owner directives, decision log, design
  dossiers, and historical research evidence.
- `mcts_mem/` — current design decisions plus rejected alternatives.
- `archive/` — inert historical material. No active tool, build, test, or
  source import may read from it.

## Current authority

The owner replaced the self-host-first wfc/democ route on 2026-07-20. The old
implementations are archived and there is no disposable Rust compiler. Exact
v0.8 remains the immutable active specification and evidence baseline, but its
recorded contradictions block a production parser pending an approved
successor. Phase 1's audited Rust-foundation handoff is complete. Phase 2's
standalone grammar-change verifier and evidence package are the active and sole
authorized implementation tranche. A specification change, active-target
switch, production parser, Phase 3 or later work, release claim, and any future
self-hosting require the separate gates in `THE-PLAN.md`.

The active foundation contains `whitefoot-contract`, `whitefoot-lexer`,
`whitefoot-source-audit`, and the binary-only
`whitefoot-lexical-observer`. The observer is evidence only, and the source
audit checks exact source/specification binding only. No production parser,
semantic kernel, artifact, backend, compiler executable, or release capability
exists yet.
