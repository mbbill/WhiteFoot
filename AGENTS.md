# xlang — agent onboarding

xlang is a systems language for AI-written, human-approved code. Entire bug
classes are unrepresentable (memory corruption, races, silent overflow,
uninitialized reads); there is no unsafe escape. The checker's proofs double
as optimizer facts: safety checks are always on unless a machine-verified
proof discharges them — speed is earned by proof, never by weakening a check.

## Read order (do this before working)

1. `THE-PLAN.md` — the current map: beliefs, evidence ledger, ranked bets.
2. Tail of `optimizer-language-research/implementation/decision-gates.md` —
   the append-only lab log; the last ~10 entries are the live context.
3. `mcts_mem/` — the design-decision tree: before proposing any non-trivial
   design change, read the relevant node and its `.alt/` (what was already
   tried and why it lost).
4. As needed: `CONSTITUTION.md` (law), `PATTERNS.md` (the closed pattern
   doctrine — blessed shapes writers must use), `spec/kernel-spec-v0.6.md`
   (the 90-rule language spec), `optimizer-language-research/notes/user-directives.md`
   (binding owner rulings and amendments).

## Verify (before AND after your work)

- `make check` — root gate: spec CI, rule tests, soundness, perf pins,
  codegen parity + corpus, conformance. Must be green.
- `make -C compiler check` — xlc (the production compiler, written in xlang,
  bootstrapped by `prototype/democ`). Must be green.

## Standing rules (owner-ratified; do not relitigate)

- English-only repository: every new or modified repository artifact must be
  written in English. This includes source identifiers that use natural-language
  words, comments, diagnostics, string literals intended for readers, test names,
  fixtures, documentation, reports, plans, prompts, project-authored datasets,
  and file or directory names. Do not add translations or language-suffixed
  variants. Programming-language tokens, formal mathematical notation, numeric
  data, and external proper names are allowed, but all surrounding prose must be
  English. Before finishing a change, scan changed contents and filenames for
  non-English prose.
- `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are repository-level agent instructions and must
  remain byte-identical. Update both in the same change.
- Durability: commit + one `decision-gates.md` line per completed step.
  Sessions get rewound; git log + gates tail are how work resumes.
- Fact channels (anything that lets the optimizer assume more) get hostile
  adversarial review BEFORE shipping. A green gate is not a review.
- Never trade a check for speed at the source level; proof-elision is the
  only path (PATTERNS P8). `move`/checks/rows have exactly one spelling.
- Report results to the owner in plain language; keep project codenames in
  the repo logs, not in chat.
- Subagent tiering: sonnet only for mechanical work, opus for most tasks,
  top tier for subtle soundness reasoning. Never haiku.
- Framing: performance and correctness language only.

## Layout

- `compiler/` — xlc, the self-hosting compiler (xlang sources, Python-run
  stage-0 tests). The active build track.
- `prototype/` — democ (stage-0 compiler) + checker; reference semantics.
- `spec/` — kernel spec, derivation ledger, FR reconciliation.
- `conformance/`, `codegen-corpus/`, `tools/` — the verification stack.
- `experiments/` — active measured evidence (see its README).
- `optimizer-language-research/` — the lab log (`implementation/decision-gates.md`),
  owner directives (`notes/`), design docs + reviews (`implementation/`).
- `mcts_mem/` — the design-decision tree; read the relevant node + its
  `.alt/` before proposing any non-trivial design change; keep it true per
  the mcts-mem discipline (re-decisions move the old form into `.alt/` with
  paired whys, in the same change as the code).
- `archive/` — superseded plans, the research-era record, shelved harnesses.
  Read-only context; nothing in it gates anything.

## Current focus (2026-07-15)

- Candidate C sparse paper repair is active under
  `optimizer-language-research/implementation/minimal-systems-capability/
  CANDIDATE-C-SPARSE-REPAIR-PLAN.md`. The owner selected C as the first
  bounded validation hypothesis, B as the later compression challenge, and A
  as the generality fallback; this is not a production ranking. Stage 0 and
  Stage 1 are complete. The five-operation Hashbrown paper calibration reached
  `C-REVISE`: C-4 is the right reusable sparse family, but exact control-to-
  payload, transition/cleanup, provenance, fact, group-operation, and growth-
  allocation rules remain absent. No new family was admitted, and no safety,
  code-shape, or performance closure was claimed. The current authorization
  compares exactly three paper repairs over the existing five operations and
  fifteen rows, then stops at the Sparse Repair Gate. It does not apply a
  repair or reopen source inspection. Keep the 340
  unresolved dense obligations across 150 contexts and exact D-2/P-1 fail-
  closed. No Stage 2, allocator, SQLite,
  Crossbeam, Tokio, Wasmtime, safety
  model, prototype, machine-event work, performance or AI trial, language/
  specification/compiler/verifier/runtime implementation, capability entry,
  standard library, container, candidate execution, benchmark, E0.1 restart,
  migration, or default teaching is authorized.
- xlc self-hosting build in `compiler/` (SoA-tape architecture per P2).
- D9a is complete on two independently preregistered shipped-library targets.
  First-green `gpt-5.6-terra`/medium xlang beats `percent-encoding` 2.3.2 by
  1.653x [1.631, 1.667] and one-shot `utf8parse` 0.2.2 by 1.098x
  [1.085, 1.145]. Both retain every bounds site, so this is replicated
  default-shape evidence, not proof-elision evidence. The utf8parse facts
  control is statistically inconclusive, but facts-on/off reports and optimized
  instruction bodies are identical. Do not tune either completed protocol
  from its result.
- Proof tier: PROOF-1/2 shipped and adversarially reviewed; the accounting
  design's approved first slice is in
  `optimizer-language-research/implementation/requires-check-accounting-REVIEW.md`.
