# xlang

A systems language for AI-written, human-approved code. The checker makes the
memory-corruption, data-race, silent-overflow, and uninitialized-read bug
classes unrepresentable — no unsafe escape exists — and its proofs feed the
optimizer, so checked code runs at C-class speed: safety checks are always on
unless a machine-verified proof discharges them.

Highlights so far (each with a RESULTS.md under `experiments/`):
- default floor: first-green `gpt-5.6-terra` xlang programs beat the ordinary
  public paths of two released Rust crates by 1.653x and 1.098x on locked
  workloads, with every reported xlang bounds check retained.
- base64: byte-identical to system tools; the complete CLI beats the measured
  GNU, uutils, and BSD tools, while the scalar kernel is in practical parity
  with expert safe Rust. Proofs make the same xlang source 1.71x faster, with
  the capacity contract enforced at the boundary — even for C callers.
- wc: byte-identical under LC_ALL=C, ~2x GNU coreutils on default invocation.
- The classifier-kernel study: i1-dataflow parity with C and safe Rust.
- Checked algebraic laws: 3.3x on reductions, with FALSE laws refuted at
  compile time — the transform Rust must take on faith.

| I want to... | Go to |
|---|---|
| Understand the project state | `THE-PLAN.md`, then the tail of `optimizer-language-research/implementation/decision-gates.md` |
| Work in this repo as an agent | `CLAUDE.md` |
| Read the law / the doctrine | `CONSTITUTION.md` / `PATTERNS.md` |
| Read the language spec | `spec/kernel-spec-v0.6.md` (+ `spec/derivation-ledger.md` for why each rule exists) |
| The production compiler (xlc, self-hosting) | `compiler/` |
| The stage-0 compiler + checker | `prototype/` |
| Run all verification | `make check` and `make -C compiler check` |
| Measured evidence | `experiments/` (index in its README) |
| Owner rulings | `optimizer-language-research/notes/user-directives.md` |
| Superseded history | `archive/` |

## Verification

Two gates, both required green: `make check` (spec CI, rule tests, soundness
probes, performance pins, codegen parity corpus, conformance suite) and
`make -C compiler check` (the xlc test stack, including the self-parse gate).
Every completed unit of work commits with a one-line entry in the decision
log — the repo is designed so that any fresh session can resume from
`git log` plus the log tail alone.
