# Whitefoot idea bank

Status: NON-AUTHORITATIVE.

`docs/roadmap.md` alone controls current work, order, gates, and authorization.
This file preserves ideas that may deserve a bounded experiment after an owner
promotes one. An entry here does not open a project phase or change a language,
compiler, runtime, or deployment contract.

Whitefoot keeps facts in source that other languages discard. LLVM optimization
is one consumer of those facts. The ideas below ask whether the same checked
facts can also buy portability, automated tuning, stronger testing, safer
interop, or tighter deployment controls.

## A portable C backend

Whitefoot could emit C from the same checked typed IR that feeds the LLVM
backend. Users would write Whitefoot, retain Whitefoot's safety rules, and use
C toolchains to reach platforms that lack a supported LLVM path.

Standard C cannot express all LLVM properties. Per-instruction alias scopes,
`dereferenceable`, precise memory effects, `willreturn`, and several arithmetic
facts have no exact portable-C spelling. A sound backend therefore needs one
recorded disposition for each fact:

1. consume the fact while generating C;
2. encode it in portable C;
3. encode it in a reviewed compiler profile such as Clang, GCC, or MSVC; or
4. retain the runtime check and accept the missed optimization.

The backend must generate defined C. It must avoid signed overflow before a
check, out-of-bounds pointer formation, invalid shifts, unjustified `restrict`,
padding reads, alignment violations, and assumptions that can become undefined
behavior. The portable profile would promise correct compilation. Named
compiler profiles could make separate, measured performance claims.

First experiment: lower a small corpus that covers bounds discharge, exclusive
borrows, checked arithmetic, and effect attributes. Compile it with two C
compilers, compare results and traps with the LLVM backend, run C sanitizers,
and inspect both assembly and throughput. Stop if the backend needs an
unreviewable undefined-behavior assumption or cannot provide a checked fallback.

## Proof-guided autotuning

An autotuner could generate several implementations of one checked operation:
different data layouts, unroll factors, SIMD widths, branch structures, or
specializations. The checker would admit variants after proving that they
preserve the source contract. A target benchmark would choose among them.

This separates semantic authority from cost selection. The benchmark runner
may choose the fastest proved variant, but benchmark noise cannot make an
unsafe variant legal.

First experiment: choose one bounded kernel with a scalar reference and two
plausible fast shapes. Freeze the input distribution and target, verify every
variant against the same differential corpus, then measure whether target
selection beats a fixed compiler choice without expanding the trusted base.

## A proof-gap performance coach

The compiler could explain each retained check and missed optimization in
terms the writer can act on. A report might say that an index check remains
because no dominating fact proves `offset + 16 <= len`, or that a loop cannot
vectorize because two live places may overlap.

An automated tool could propose a rewrite constrained to the canonical
patterns, run the checker and performance protocol, and present the source
diff, proof delta, and measurement for human approval. The tool would never add
an assumption or weaken a check. It would change source structure until the
checker derives the needed fact.

First experiment: use the observational proof reports planned for the
facts-on compiler. Select ten retained bounds or alias checks, generate one
mechanical suggestion for each, and measure suggestion validity, proof closure,
code-shape change, and runtime change. Preserve every failed suggestion as a
regression for the diagnostic or rewrite rule that produced it.

## Multiple backends as mutual oracles

Independent LLVM, C, and future WebAssembly backends could compile the same
checked program. A differential runner would compare values, traps, external
effects, and resource teardown. Each disagreement would produce the smallest
practical regression before a backend fix closes.

This approach can catch a lowering defect that source conformance misses. It
also gives the C backend value before its generated code reaches the LLVM
backend's performance.

First experiment: run the existing codegen corpus through LLVM and portable C.
Compile the C at low and high optimization levels with two compilers. Require
the same result and trap class for valid and adversarial inputs, including
failure paths.

## Safe C ABI capsules

Whitefoot could package a module as generated C plus a generated header. The
header would expose opaque validated handles, constructors, operations, and
drop functions instead of internal pointers or layouts. Boundary code would
validate lengths, tags, handle generations, ownership transitions, and error
paths before Whitefoot code receives authority.

This would let a C program consume a Whitefoot library without asking the C
caller to reproduce Whitefoot's lifetime and alias rules. Arbitrary C code can
still corrupt its own process, so stronger isolation would require a process or
sandbox boundary.

First experiment: export one stateful component through an opaque-handle API.
Generate misuse tests for stale handles, double drop, overlapping buffers,
short outputs, and allocation failure. Require deterministic rejection and no
partial mutation on each failing call.

## A C-to-Whitefoot assumption extractor

A migration tool could ingest a restricted C kernel and identify the
assumptions that make it work: bounds assertions, `restrict`, signed-overflow
expectations, alignment, object lifetime, and unchecked pointer arithmetic.
The tool would translate supported code into Whitefoot and turn each assumption
into an explicit checked obligation. It would reject code whose behavior
depends on an assumption Whitefoot cannot state or prove.

The extractor should favor an incomplete translation over invented semantics.
Its main artifact would be an assumption ledger that a reviewer can inspect
before approving the translated Whitefoot source.

First experiment: select a small, defined-behavior C loop with one bounds
contract and one alias contract. Mutate the contracts one at a time and require
the extractor or Whitefoot checker to reject the corresponding program.

## Resource certificates

The compiler could emit a machine-readable resource certificate beside an
artifact. Depending on the program and its entry contracts, the certificate
could record stack and heap bounds, allocation counts, remaining trap sites,
input-size constraints, external effects, and proved loop bounds.

Embedded, real-time, and serverless systems could check the certificate against
a deployment budget before running the program. Unknown bounds must remain
unknown; the certificate must not turn a profile observation into a guarantee.

First experiment: certify a fixed-capacity, allocation-free kernel. Compare the
reported stack and memory bounds with instrumented executions at all boundary
sizes, then use mutations to ensure an added allocation or enlarged buffer
invalidates the certificate.

## Effect-derived sandbox policies

Once Whitefoot has production I/O and FFI, the compiler could derive a sandbox
manifest from checked effect rows. A deployment tool could translate that
manifest into a WASI capability set, syscall policy, filesystem allowlist, or
network policy for a named platform.

The effect system would remain the source of authority. Platform policy
generators would consume its output and fail closed when the platform cannot
represent a restriction.

First experiment: define a tiny abstract effect set and one sandbox target.
Generate policies for pure, read-only, and network-using fixtures. Mutation
tests should add one hidden effect at a time and require either a broader
manifest or compiler rejection.

## Optimization receipts

A release artifact could carry a compact receipt for each removed safety
check. Each row would connect a source site to the proved proposition, proof
producer, invalidators, backend consumer, emitted IR, and final code location.
Reviewers could inspect why an operation has no runtime guard without
reconstructing the optimizer's reasoning.

Receipts must describe the frozen artifact rather than a nearby build. Source,
proof report, IR, object, and receipt hashes would need to agree.

First experiment: emit receipts for one bounds-proof family. Break each
premise in turn and require the check to return, the receipt row to disappear,
and the program to retain correct checked behavior.

## Common admission questions

Before an owner promotes one of these ideas, its experiment should answer:

- Which checked proposition does the idea consume?
- Does the consumer affect correctness, performance, or both?
- Which producer and invalidators govern the proposition?
- What safe behavior remains when the target cannot represent the fact?
- Which hostile mutation demonstrates that the consumer fails closed?
- Which correctness, code-shape, and performance observations decide the
  experiment?
- Which result stops the work instead of expanding its scope?

Most entries depend on the stable proposition, provenance, consumer, and
invalidator ledger described by phase 4 of `docs/roadmap.md`. Until that ledger and
its hostile reviews exist, these entries remain design prompts rather than
compiler work.
