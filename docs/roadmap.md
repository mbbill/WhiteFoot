# THE PLAN

Status: CANONICAL ROADMAP, corrected 2026-07-22.

## Goal

The target is a serious research compiler: general enough to implement the
real language, clean enough to evolve, and capable of compiling nontrivial
programs so we can test semantics and performance ideas quickly. It is not an
untrusted-input service or a stable LLVM-scale product.

The compiler must be more than democ: it uses general language rules rather
than source-shaped exceptions, has independent correctness tests, produces
useful diagnostics, emits executable programs, and remains maintainable as the
specification changes. But it does not need release engineering for millions
of users, stable external protocols, adversarial resource guarantees,
transactional publication, or exhaustive operational failure handling.

The practical destination is:

```text
source programs
  -> complete frontend
  -> name resolution and semantic checking
  -> simple checked IR
  -> LLVM and runtime
  -> executable programs
  -> language and performance experiments
```

Specifications, tests, design notes, evidence, and tools serve this path. They
are not parallel products.

## Priority rule

When work competes, choose in this order:

1. the next meaningful end-to-end language or performance experiment;
2. semantic correctness and Whitefoot's required safety checks;
3. code that is understandable and easy to change;
4. enough independent evidence to trust the current result; and
5. robustness or polish only when a real experiment needs it.

Before doing supporting work, name the concrete compiler capability or
experiment it unlocks. If the supporting system becomes larger or more complex
than that capability, stop and choose a smaller route.

Function counts, issue counts, facet counts, protocol completeness, document
counts, and receipt counts do not measure progress. A useful compiled program,
a general semantic capability, a caught correctness bug, or a meaningful
measurement does.

## Current state

The active language authority is `spec/kernel-spec-v0.12.md`, SHA-256
`e2d5566379891454c090e037bd45c5f1a8df90ba23506a0f83ce9aaa03b41463`.
Those bytes are immutable and byte-identical to the owner-approved candidate.
Exact v0.8 through v0.11 remain immutable historical evidence. v0.12 adds the
SET-1 copy-place assignment judgment, target-before-RHS ordering, post-RHS
writability revalidation, and ultimate-storage-origin read/write effects.

The Rust compiler now has one ordinary path from ordered source transport
through the lossless frontend and direct resolver into semantic checking, a
private checked program, target-independent typed control-flow IR,
conservative textual LLVM, and a runnable host executable. The scalar family
supports exact integer and unit values, `Bool`, integer and unit constants,
nongeneric own-mode functions, locals, direct named calls, explicit returns,
pure/traps effects, wrapping and trapping add/subtract/multiply, integer
comparisons, Boolean operations, and nominal tag equality.

The first Phase 8 slice adds nongeneric own-mode acyclic structs and enums,
construction, nested struct projection, statement and value matches, exact
field/order and exhaustiveness checks, `give` delivery, and whole-binding
affine moves. The same typed CFG and LLVM path handles cross-function
aggregates, tag-only enums, and payload enums. Reverse-order affine cleanup is
explicit on checked return, give, and match-fallthrough edges before lowering;
an affine field move records the untouched sibling subtrees to drop at the
consuming projection, including nested paths. Current resource-free nominal
drops need no runtime action. Required checks
remain explicit through lowering and emit the exact DIAG-3 record before abort.

The v0.12 activation adds one general SET-1 path for the place families the
compiler already represents: live own-mode scalar/tag-only-enum locals and
nested copy fields inside acyclic structs. Semantic checking forms the target
before the RHS, rejects constants and affine final places under their owning
rules, checks the exact RHS type, and revalidates root liveness afterward. The
checked program retains the root and field path; lowering performs an SSA
rebinding or rebuilds the required aggregate layers with LLVM `insertvalue`.
Focused host tests execute root and nested-field updates and preserve siblings.

Structured `loop` and resolved labelled `break` now use that same checked and
lowered control-flow path. Loop-entry and break-exit blocks carry the current
binding values as typed parameters, so arbitrary copy-local and tag-only-enum
updates become ordinary LLVM phi nodes. Nested labels route to their resolved
loop identities; FN-1 rejects unreachable suffixes; OWN-11 rejects consuming
an affine binding declared outside the loop; and checked break/backedge edges
retain their derived cleanup. Existing compiler-independent accumulator and
loop-carried-enum programs execute through the host backend.

This is not a completeness claim. Generics and contracts, regions and borrows,
floats, Result values and propagation, allocations and containers,
recursive nominal layouts, branch-dependent ownership joins, index and
borrow-backed SET-1 targets, and the remaining operation/effect table are
explicit unsupported compiler capabilities rather than source-language
rejections. Repeated exhaustive match arms also stop as unsupported because
v0.12 defines neither duplicate-arm meaning nor a duplicate-arm rejection
rule.

The exact approved v0.12 candidate is installed and every live identity names
it. The resolver implementation completes Phase 6, the first executable scalar
slice completes Phase 7, and nominal data plus the current SET-1 place family
advance Phase 8. The next work is the closed PRE-1 `Result` path used by checked
integer arithmetic and `propagate`: contextual Result instantiation,
construction/matching across calls and returns, checked-operation lowering,
and exact Err forwarding. That is the smallest family that unlocks the next
existing nontrivial executable program and a real recoverable-error path.

## Authority and specification changes

`docs/constitution.md` is project law. The active numbered specification defines the
language. `docs/patterns.md` defines writer forms. This file alone defines current
implementation order. Architecture and research documents are explanations and
inputs, not additional entrance gates.

A compiler/specification discrepancy stops the affected behavior for
investigation. Compiler behavior, tests, archived implementations, and design
prose cannot silently define the language.

The numbered specification is append-only: a released `spec/kernel-spec-v*.md`
is never edited, renamed, or deleted, and a pre-commit hook enforces it (install
once with `make install-hooks`). Amending the language is allowed, with care — a
change batch goes into a new numbered version. State the exact change, keep it
minimal, record its durable rationale in `mcts_mem/`, and record protected owner
approval in `governance/APPROVALS.md`.

Before proposing a spec change, verify the new grammar with the grammar
verifier: a proposed specification must pass the main compiler's own lexer and
parser and satisfy the grammar constraints (parses, strong-LL(2), clean
terminal partition, no conflicts).

When the specification changes, everything derived from it is brought to the
newest version in the same work: conformance cases and verdicts, the
lexer/parser and generated syntax data, tests, and docs. This consistency is
the responsibility of whoever changes the spec; it is not machine-enforced,
and derived material is never silently weakened to make a check pass.

**Grammar proposal check.** The native `whitefoot-grammar` tool verifies an
unchanged frontend contract against the active compiler, checks the complete
FORM-1-through-GRAM contract plus the CONST-1 and EFF-1 grammar fragments,
checks every compiler SELECT_2 decision, and runs the real lexer and parser. It
fails closed on a grammar change. A future structural proposal must extend this
same native path; it may not revive the archived independent grammar engines.
This tool is run for specification proposals, not routine compilation.

## What “good enough” requires

The research compiler must:

- implement each supported language capability by grammar and semantic rule,
  never by function name, source shape, project, or corpus membership;
- keep unsupported implementation capability distinct from language rejection;
- exercise all supported capability through one normal compiler pipeline;
- preserve every required runtime safety check unless a verified fact removes
  it;
- produce deterministic results where tests and measurements depend on them;
- use safe Rust without `unsafe` escape;
- keep modules cohesive and internal boundaries easy to revise;
- test semantic rules independently of the compiler where that materially
  increases confidence; and
- compile nontrivial dogfood programs that expose missing language and compiler
  capabilities.

It does not currently require:

- hard service-level limits for hostile input;
- a versioned whole-compiler `ResourceProfile`;
- evidence-selected numerical maxima before implementation;
- exact allocation-failure coverage for every Rust dependency;
- process sandboxes, transactional publication, crash recovery, or stable
  artifact interchange;
- a second semantic verifier or mandatory artifact replay;
- portable identities for private compiler records;
- stable internal APIs or compatibility with unknown external consumers;
- exhaustive failure taxonomies for paths that only compiler developers use;
  or
- release qualification for multiple hosts and targets.

Use normal Rust collections and allocation. Keep obvious size arithmetic
checked, avoid accidental unbounded recursion, and fix observed resource or
performance failures. Existing local limits may remain when they are simple
and tested, but do not expand them into a separate resource product. Resource
exhaustion is a compiler/development failure, not a source-language verdict.

## Implementation approach

Work in vertical language-capability slices once the shared resolver exists.
Each slice must implement a coherent family across semantic checking, checked
IR, lowering, runtime behavior, diagnostics, and tests. A slice may temporarily
leave other valid Whitefoot programs reported as not yet implemented; it may
not misclassify them as invalid.

This is not the old function-by-function route. A capability such as integer
operations, direct calls, structs, or loans must work for arbitrary legal
names, function counts, source order, nesting, and program shape. Dogfood
projects reveal which capability should come next, but production code never
special-cases a dogfood project.

For the next slice only, write down:

1. the exact active rules it implements;
2. its input and output;
3. what source is accepted, rejected, or explicitly not yet implemented;
4. the data required by its immediate downstream consumer; and
5. the smallest independent tests likely to expose a wrong implementation.

Then code it. Private structures may change freely while learning. Do not
design stable schemas, generalized frameworks, artifact protocols, or future
backend abstractions before a real consumer exists.

Resolve specification questions just in time. If the next capability is
blocked, present the exact behavior alternatives and evidence. Do not fill the
pause with unrelated infrastructure.

## Phase 1: repository and Rust foundation

Status: complete.

Obsolete wfc and democ implementations were archived. The continuing safe-Rust
workspace, specification governance, and compiler-independent conformance data
were established. The historical Python reference model was later archived;
it consumed its own toy AST and did not exercise or compare with the Rust
compiler.

## Phase 2: grammar evidence

Status: complete.

The historical independent evidence established the terminal partition,
grammar conflicts, and lookahead needed for the frontend. The active native
proposal check now reuses the compiler as described above and is not part of
normal compilation.

## Phase 3: exact v0.9 installation

Status: complete.

Exact v0.9 was installed through the protected versioning procedure. Its bytes
and version-bound evidence remain immutable.

## Phase 4: canonical frontend

Status: complete, except ordinary bug fixes.

The lexer, classifier, parser, topology/source finalizer, and FORM-2 check
produce one `CanonicalSyntaxUnit`. A reproducible bug receives a focused
regression and direct fix; it does not justify a new support framework.

## Phase 5: activate v0.10

Status: complete.

Install the exact approved v0.10 candidate without editing it. Update its live
identity references and reproduce the current grammar and frontend evidence.
Do not add semantic implementation, resource measurement machinery, or new
frontend architecture during the version switch.

**Exit:** v0.10 is the active immutable target and the existing canonical
frontend passes against it.

## Phase 6: direct name resolver

Status: complete.

Implement the exact v0.10 declaration inventory and lexical resolution rules
over `CanonicalSyntaxUnit`. Use straightforward owned records and deterministic
lookup structures.

The resolver must cover every grammar-defined declaration and use role, all
specified scopes and visibility, reservations, duplicates, shadowing,
declaration-before-use, top-level function visibility, operation families, and
deterministic diagnostics. Owner/member relations that require types remain
explicit deferred records for the type checker.

Do not implement the abandoned measurement routes, replay protocols, receipt
identities, or a versioned 33-field resource schema. Use the ordinary compiler
data structures the algorithm needs.

**Exit:** arbitrary v0.10 programs receive either a complete resolved unit, a
spec-defined resolution error, or an explicit later-stage/not-yet-implemented
result. Resolver unit, property, mutation, and conformance cases are green.

The resolver covers D01-D14, X01-X03, U01-U18, and X04-X09 through one general
path. Its unit, property, mutation, selected existing-conformance, and
hostile-review cases are green. The owner reconciled the protected
`fn7-neg-two-mains` expectation with exact v0.10: the later duplicate `main`
declaration receives TYPE-6, while a missing or unique wrong-signature `main`
remains FN-7.

## Phase 7: first executable semantic slice

Status: complete.

Hostile preflight found that v0.10 deliberately leaves post-resolution
semantic diagnostic validity and determinism boundary for later approval. It
also does not close the ordinary `check` operand type, function fallthrough,
the exact scalar integer wrap/trap/compare behavior needed by the first backend
slice, or the conflict between DIAG-2/DIAG-3 product-scale artifact/report
obligations and the current research-compiler architecture. Do not invent
these behaviors in compiler code or derive them from LLVM.

The owner approved and activated a minimal v0.11 revision that closes only
those semantic boundaries, preserves all required runtime checks, and replaces
product-scale artifact/replay obligations with the smallest checked in-memory
authority and runtime-report contract the research compiler needs. Review rejected both a
whole-language diagnostic-owner census and a normative first-slice support
profile: neither affects language acceptance, and both would couple the
specification to implementation order. The candidate instead requires every
semantic rejection to establish an actual numbered-rule violation, keeps
rule-specific locations exact, makes simultaneous post-resolution first-error
choice deterministic per compiler executable, and publishes checked authority
only after every applicable whole-unit judgment succeeds. The compiler-sharing
grammar verifier and hostile review are complete, and the exact approved bytes
now define compiler behavior.

Choose the smallest coherent language family that can compile and run a real
program while exercising the actual semantic architecture. The expected first
slice includes primitive values, constants, function signatures and direct
calls, local bindings, basic control flow, required arithmetic modes and
checks, and the minimum ownership/effect behavior those forms require.

Implement the family end to end:

```text
resolved syntax
  -> typed checked representation
  -> simple target-independent IR
  -> LLVM for one host target
  -> runtime checks
  -> executable
```

The backend may be simple and inefficient. Correct facts-off behavior matters;
backend abstraction, stable IR serialization, caching, and optimization do not.

**Exit:** at least one nontrivial compiler-independent program and the complete
tests for the supported family compile and run through the normal pipeline.

The completed slice uses grammar and resolved identities rather than function
or corpus allowlists. Whole-unit semantic success is the only lowering
authority. Its checked representation records exact scalar types and values,
direct calls, retained OP-2/OP-5 checks, trap attribution, and returns; lowering
then produces one target-independent IR and one conservative host LLVM path.
Wrapping arithmetic carries no LLVM overflow promises, trapping arithmetic
uses explicit signed/unsigned overflow intrinsics and branches, and explicit
checks are never elided. `unit` remains a first-class source value across
locals, parameters, calls, and returns.

Independent positive and negative conformance sources exercise constants,
FORM-7, named calls, TYPE-5, FN-2, EFF-2, wrapping arithmetic, and normal
execution through this same path. Focused host tests cover every implemented
integer width/sign lowering, mandatory OP-2 and OP-5 trap records, check
retention, and the absence of `nsw`, `nuw`, or `llvm.assume` claims.

## Phase 8: expand semantic capability

Status: in progress.

Add coherent language families in dependency and experimental-value order,
each end to end through execution. The likely families are:

1. aggregates, enums, construction, projection, and pattern matching;
2. generic types, constants, functions, instance closure, and contracts;
3. regions, borrows, loans, moves, joins, and cleanup;
4. slices, arenas, storage roots, and provenance-sensitive operations;
5. effects, recursive call graphs, remaining control flow, and whole-program
   checks; and
6. target/ABI behavior required by dogfood programs.

This order may change when real dependency or dogfood evidence says it should.
Changing order must name the experiment unlocked; it may not be justified by
which issue list is easiest to clear.

**Exit:** every construct in the active specification has one general semantic
and lowering path, and the compiler adapter passes the full conformance suite
after its sources and expected verdicts have been reconciled with the active
specification. The suite is evidence, not language authority: an inherited
case or expectation that contradicts the specification is corrected through
`WORKFLOW.md` and protected owner approval, never implemented merely to make an
old test pass.

The implemented nominal-data subset covers nongeneric own-mode acyclic structs
and enums. It implements construction, nested projection, statement and value
matching, `give`, exact GRAM-8/GRAM-10 declared-field diagnostics,
TYPE-5/TYPE-6 typing, per-site ERR-2 exhaustiveness rejection with the missing
variant list, OWN-1/OWN-13 copy-versus-affine consumption, explicit checked
cleanup edges, and tag-only enum equality through the normal checked-program,
typed-CFG, LLVM, and host-execution path. Independent positive and negative
cases cover cross-function aggregate values, mixed-width and multi-field enum
payloads, every Boolean operation, nested fields, ownership failures, wrong
variants, missing arms, and invalid field order.

The implemented SET-1 subset covers direct live own-mode copy locals and nested
copy fields. One checked writable-place record carries the root and path across
RHS checking; lowering uses the existing binding map and one struct-insertion
operation rather than a second mutation pipeline. Constants cite CONST-2,
affine final places cite STOR-1 with the required restructuring, type mismatch
cites TYPE-5 at the RHS, and an RHS that moves the root cites OWN-1 at the later
commit. Dereference, index, slice, buffer, box, arena, and loan-aware targets
remain unsupported because their underlying type/storage/borrow families are
not implemented; they are not treated as invalid source.

This is not the complete ERR-2 toolchain contract: a whole-unit
variant-addition query that enumerates every affected match site is still
pending. The compiler adapter also does not yet implement the full independent
conformance manifest. Neither is claimed by the current green gate.

Direct recursive nominal layout and branch-dependent affine state joins remain
explicit implementation limits, as do repeated exhaustive match arms; no
source-language rule has been invented for them. Loops with a structurally
reachable break now run through the same checked CFG and LLVM path. Header and
exit block parameters carry current bindings, nested break targets use resolved
loop identities, OWN-11 blocks outer affine consumption, and normal backedges
and breaks retain explicit cleanup. A loop with no structurally reachable break
remains an explicit lowering limitation rather than a source rejection.

Next implement the closed PRE-1 `Result` family required by checked integer
operations and `propagate`. It must work for arbitrary supported payload types,
functions, names, nesting, and source order through the one nominal/control-flow
path; it may not special-case the existing `run-ex2` source. Buffers, index
places, and loan-aware SET-1 targets follow when their storage and borrow
families become the experiment being unlocked.

## Phase 9: dogfood and language iteration

Continuously use production-shaped but manageable projects to reveal missing
features and bad design. Cover at least binary data/compression, text and
command-line processing, collections or graph-shaped work, and one sustained
workload. zlib remains a useful example, not a privileged target.

When dogfood reveals a language problem, change the specification through the
numbered process and update the compiler. When it reveals a compiler problem,
add a minimized independent regression. When it reveals performance behavior,
measure before redesigning.

The compiler is successful when it can support these experiments reliably and
can be changed without repeatedly rebuilding unrelated infrastructure.

## Phase 10: optimizer experiments

Keep facts-off compilation correct. Add proof-based check removal and other
optimizations one proposition family at a time, with focused independent
verification and facts-on/facts-off comparisons. Optimize measured problems,
not hypothetical workloads.

The preserved `tests/codegen/` sources are a pool of historical experiments,
not a completion checklist or an active gate. Do not revive the democ runner or
assume its manifests and expected code shapes are correct. Promote a selected
case into a small regression owned by the current Rust compiler only after
reconciling its source, semantic expectation, and code-generation hypothesis
with the active specification and the experiment that needs it; explicitly
retire obsolete hypotheses instead of preserving them as accidental compiler
requirements.

An optimizer fact may improve an accepted program but may not change source
acceptance or remove a required check without proof.

## Phase 11: optional hardening

Only if later use justifies it, consider stable artifacts, caching, broader
targets, stronger resource controls, transactional publication, distribution,
self-hosting, or a product release. None blocks the research compiler or the
current experiments.

## Verification and durability

Run `make -C compiler check` before and after compiler changes and `make check`
for each completed repository slice. A green gate states only what it tests;
it is not a claim that the language or compiler is complete.

Every reproducible defect receives the smallest practical regression before
its fix. Each cohesive completed step gets one commit. Update current phase
status in this file, durable design choices in `mcts_mem/`, and protected owner
approvals in `governance/APPROVALS.md` when those records materially change.

Keep files cohesive and reviewable. Split by invariant-bearing responsibility,
not arbitrary line counts or corpus functions. New and modified repository
content uses English. `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` remain byte-identical.

## Prohibited routes

- No function-by-function, signature-by-signature, corpus-by-corpus, or
  issue-count-clearing implementation strategy.
- No source-shaped dispatch, function allowlist, project special case, or test
  identity in compiler semantics or lowering.
- No disposable compiler, parallel semantic implementation, or premature
  self-hosting detour.
- No product-scale resource profile, replay system, receipt/identity scheme,
  publication protocol, sandbox, or failure taxonomy without a current
  experimental need.
- No placeholder artifact, schema, proof record, backend abstraction, or
  generalized framework before its real producer and consumer.
- No later-phase infrastructure used as filler while the next real compiler
  capability is blocked.
- No silent specification reinterpretation, protected-test weakening, or
  baseline regeneration merely to make a gate green.
- No optional optimizer fact changing acceptance or removing an unproved
  required check.
- No active source, build, test, or tool dependency on `archive/`.
